They can be used to add new recipes, or overwrite existing\nones.\nRecipes are JSON files located in the data/ /recipe folder.\n\nJSON format\n\nSince recipe files represent a variety of different recipe types, the format can vary. However, there are some fields\nwhich appear in every recipe file.\n\ntype\n\nDetermines which type of recipe this is. Possible values:\n\n| Type                     | Description                                                                                                                              |\n| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| blasting               | A recipe for a blast furnace                                                                                                             |\n| campfire\\_cooking       | A recipe for cooking items on a campfire                                                                                                 |\n| crafting\\_shaped        | A shaped crafting recipe in a crafting table.

Function files end in .mcfunction, and are\nlocated in the data/ /function folder. Functions can be called (ran) using the function command. (See\n/function for more information)\n\nThe function folder can contain sub-folders for organisation. This changes their reference accordingly - for example,\na function located at data/ /function/sub\\_folder/my\\_func.mcfunction would be called using\nfunction :sub\\_folder/my\\_func.\n\nWhen a function is run, the commands within it are executed in order. If the return command is run, the function stops\nexecuting immediately and any commands after the return are ignored.\n\nAny line in a function which starts with a # is a comment, and the game ignores it. Any other line is interpreted\nas a command\n\nExample\n\nThis function will give every player an apple, then tell them to enjoy the apple.\n\nMacro functions\n\nMacros can dynamically change part of a function by inserting NBT into it. Any function can define a macro within it. A\nmacro is a command beginning with $. Macros can use a special syntax: $(). This will substitute for any\nvalue provided as   when run.\n\nThe /function command can specify a NBT compound to use as the macro values. In traditional programming, this is best\nrepresented as someFunction(foo, bar)\n\nExample\n\nIn this example, we write a function that gives the player a number of diamonds using a macro.\n","url":"/wiki/files/functions/"},{"title":"Tags","content":"This page is validated and up to date with Minecraft Java: 1.21\n\nTags\n\nRegistry tags, not to be confused with entity tags, are essentially lists of groups such as blocks,\nitems, entity types, etc. They use JSON format and are located in the data/ /tags/  folder.\n\nSpecial tags\n\nMinecraft uses some tags internally for certain behaviours. These tags are located in the minecraft namespace. For\nexample:\n\nany functions in the #minecraft:load function tag will be automatically run when a datapack is loaded\n\nthe #minecraft:minable/pickaxe block tag lists blocks which are mined faster using a pickaxe.\n\nIn many cases, modifying these special tags allows you to configure certain aspects of how Minecraft behaves.\n\nRegistries\n\nTags group various types in a specific registry (category).\n\nThis list shows all of the possible registry types, as well as the path their tags should be put in.\n\nItems (/tags/item)\n\nBlocks (/tags/block)\n\nEntity types (/tags/entity\\_type)\n\nFunctions (/tags/function)\n\nFluids (/tags/fluid)\n\nGame Events (/tags/game\\_event)\n\nChat Types (/tags/chat\\_type)\n\nDamage Types (/tags/damage\\_type)\n\nBanner patterns (/tags/banner\\_pattern)\n\nCat variants (/tags/cat\\_variant)\n\nEnchantments (/tags/enchantment)\n\nGoat horns (/tags/instrument)\n\nPaintings (/tags/painting\\_variant)\n\nEntity POI (/tags/point\\_of\\_interest\\_type)\n\nBiome (/tags/worldgen/biome)\n\nFlat world preset (/tags/worldgen/flat\\_level\\_generator\\_preset)\n\nStructures (/tags/worldgen/structure)\n\nWorld preset (/tags/worldgen/world\\_preset)\n\nJSON format\n\nTags have a very simple format, with two fields.\n\nreplace\n\nreplace is a boolean field which decides whether the tag should replace other tags with the same path, or merge with\nthem. For example, if \"replace\": true is added to the tick.json function tag, only the tick functions in that\ndatapack would load, as it would replace all other defined tick tags. If replace is false, it will merge with any\nvalues in tick.json within other packs. replace is an optional field, and if not specified will default to false.\n\nvalues\n\nValues (values) is an array containing everything to group under this tag. Each element is either a string or an\nobject containing an id field and a required field (object example {\"required\": false, \"id\":\"minecraft:stick\"} ).\nThe plain string and the id field contain either the ID of the entry (such as minecraft:diamond\\_block), or the ID of\nanother tag, beginning with a # (such as #minecraft:logs). The required field in the object is a boolean (true\nor false) which defines if this entry can be ignored if the id cannot be found.\n\nExample\n\nHere is an example tag, located in data/ /tags/item/wood.json.\n:::info\n\\#minecraft:logs and #minecraft:planks are two item tags provided by Minecraft.\n:::\n","url":"/wiki/files/tags/"},{"title":"/function","content":"This page is up to date and validated for the Minecraft version: 1.21\n\n/function command\n\nThis command runs any .mcfunction file when called. You can also pass in a NBT compound or NBT source path if the\nfunction is a macro function. All functions are run independently and one after another - for example, if you run\nfunction1 and then function2, then function2 will only run once function1 has finished.\n\nSyntax\n\nfunction : : Runs the .mcfunction file at data/ /function/&#x20;\n\nfunction : {key:value}: Runs the .mcfunction file at\ndata/ /function/ , and uses the {key:value} if the function is a macro function.\n\nfunction : with (block |entity |storage ) : Runs the\n.mcfunction file at data/ /function/ , and uses the NBT source if the function is a macro\nfunction.\n\n:::tip\nYou can stop a function running in real-time using the return command.\n:::\n","url":"/wiki/command/function/"},{"title":"/summon","content":"This page is up to date and validated for the Minecraft version: 1.21\n\n/summon command\n\nThe /summon command is used to summon an entity at a position, along with any entity NBT.\n\nSyntax\n\nThe syntax of the /summon command is as follows:\n\n&#x20;: an ID of a minecraft entity. For example: minecraft:cow, marker, zombie. If the namespace\n(minecraft:) is omitted, it will default to the minecraft namespace.\n\n\\[position] (optional): the coordinates at which the entity should be spawned.\n(Defaults to the current position).\n\n\\[nbt data] (optional): a compound containing the NBT (in SNBT format) which the entity should be\nspawned with. For example: {NoAI:1b}.\n\nExamples\n\nsummon minecraft:cow - Summons a cow at the current position.\n\nsummon minecraft:ender\\_dragon ~ ~50 ~ - Summons an ender dragon 50 blocks above the current position\n\nsummon minecraft:wither 29 372 121 - Summons a wither at the coordinates x=29, y=372, z=121\n\nsummon minecraft:zombie ~ ~ ~ {NoAI:1b} - Summons a zombie at the current position with the NoAI NBT, meaning it\nwill not move around or attack players.\n\nAlternatives\n\nThe execute summon  command can also be used to summon an entity. Using this\nexecute subcommand will summon an entity at the current position, and then run the specified\ncommand as the newly summoned entity.\n\nHowever, execute summon cannot provide any NBT to give the entity upon being spawned.

The execute command is\nmade up of multiple subcommands, which can be chained repeatedly and in any order to modify context in various ways.\n\nEach subcommand has its own syntax, and most allow/require another subcommand to follow.\n\nContext\n\nEvery command is executed in a context. Various execute subcommands can modify the context in which other commands are\nrun. The context includes:\n\nPosition: The position at which the command is executed (the origin of relative coordinates)\n\nAnchor: Either eyes or feet. Specifies the origin of local coordinates to either the eyes or feet of an entity.\n\nExecutor: The entity executing the command (which entity the @s selector refers to)\n\nRotation: The rotation of the command\n\nDimension: The dimension in which the command is executed\n\nForking\n\nSome commands cause a fork. That is, the following chain of subcommands get executed more than once. When a command is\nforked, it executes the fork as a whole, then proceeds to the next fork.\n\nFor example, if there are two markers A and B, and the following command is run:\nexecute as @e\\[type=marker] run function example\nAnd the example function contained the following commands:\n\nThe chat output would look like this:\n\nSubcommands\n\n:::info\nIn this documentation, ... represents another required subcommand, and \\[...] denotes that another subcommand\nis optional.\n:::\n\nexecute align...\n\nThe align subcommand aligns the executing position to the specified axes (rounding down coordinates to integers).\n&#x20; can be any subset of xyz, in any order.\n\nExamples:\n\nexecute align xz ...\nexecute align yxz ...\n\nexecute anchored (eyes|feet) ...\n\nChanges the execution anchor to the eyes or feet of the entity.\n\nExamples:\n\nexecute anchored eyes ...\n\n:::warning\nWhen the position is changed not relative to the player, it resets back to feet. You can lock this though by\nusing positioned ^ ^ ^ after it.\n:::\n\nexecute as...\n\nChanges the executor of the following subcommand to   (Does not modify any other context such as location).\nIf   refers to multiple entities, the following subcommand gets executed once for each referenced entity, with\nthat entity as the executor.\nIf   refers to no entities, the execute chain terminates and no further subcommands are run.\n\nExamples:\n\nexecute as @a\\[distance=10..] ...\nexecute as @e\\[type=pig] ...\n\nexecute at...\n\nChanges the position and rotation of the following subcommand to that of   (Executor remains the same).\nForking rules apply the same as execute as.\n\nExamples:\n\nexecute at @s ...\nexecute at @p ...\n\nexecute facing...\n\nChanges the rotation of the following subcommand to face  .\n&#x20; can either be a set of coordinates, or entity (eyes|feet), which targets the eyes or feet of the\ngiven entity.\n\nExamples:\n\nexecute facing 0 0 0 ...\nexecute facing entity @e\\[type=marker,limit=1] feet\n\nexecute in...\n\nChanges the dimension of the following subcommand to  .\nApplies dimension scaling, meaning coordinates are divided by 8 when transferring from the overworld to the nether.\n\nExamples\n\nexecute in minecraft:nether ...\n\nexecute on...\n\nChanges executor to other entities based on their relation with the current executor.

For rotated as , forking rules apply the same as as entity.\n\nExamples:\n\nexecute rotated ~10 0 ...\nexecute rotated as @e\\[tag=rotate] ...\n\nexecute summon...\n\nSummons the specified entity at the current position, and executes the following subcommand as that entity.\nNote: You cannot specify NBT data for the summoned entity.\n\nExamples:\n\nexecute summon iron\\_golem ...\nexecute summon marker ...\n\nexecute run&#x20;\n\nRuns the specified command with the current context. Takes no further subcommands.\n:::info\nThis is useless by itself, and should always be preceded by other subcommands.\n:::\n\nExamples:\n\nexecute run say hi\nexecute at @e\\[type=sheep] run setblock ~ ~ ~ stone\n\nexecute store (result|success)...\n\nStores an integer value somewhere. If storing result, this numeric value is taken from the output of the final\nsubcommand (Either a run subcommand or a condition). If storing success, the value is either 1 if the final\nsubcommand succeeds (condition passes or command successfully performs its function), or 0 otherwise.\n\ntarget can be one of the following:\n\nblock : Stores the value in the specified path of the given block in the format\nspecified by type (Any numeric NBT type), and multiplied by scale. Note: Even if type is a decimal type\n(float or double), the value is still rounded down.\n\nentity : Stores the value in the specified path of the target entity, the same way\nas block. entity must only refer to a single entity.\n\nstorage : Stores the value in the given path of the target storage in the same\nway as block and entity.\n\nscore : Stores the value for the target entity in the provided scoreboard. target can\nrefer to more than one entity.\n\nbossbar (value|max): Stores the value in a bossbar, changing either the current value or the maximum value.\n\nExamples:\n\nexecute store result entity @s Pos\\[1] double 1.5 ...\nexecute store success score $foo my\\_objective ...\nexecute store result bossbar foo\\_bar value ...\n\nexecute (if|unless) \\[...]\n\nExecutes the following subcommand under a given condition. unless inverts the condition, meaning the chain only\ncontinues if the condition not met.\n\nPossible values for condition:\n\nbiome : Checks whether a specific biome is at the given position.\n\nblock : Checks whether the given position is a certain block.\n\nblocks (all|masked): Compares two volumes of blocks: from start to end, and from\ndestination such that the second volume is the same dimensions as the first. If all is specified, it checks all\nblocks. If mask is specified, air blocks are ignored.\n\ndata (block|entity|storage) : Checks if the specified path matches the NBT data of target.\n\ndimension : Checks if the execution is in the specified dimension.\n\nentity : Checks whether target resolves to one or more entities.\n\nfunction : Runs the specified function and tests the return value. If the function did not run the\nreturn command, or if it returns zero, the condition is not met. Must be followed by another subcommand.\n\nitems (block|entity) : Checks if the given item matches the specified slot of the target\nblock or entity. item is in the format  \\[ ].\n\nloaded : Checks if the specified position is loaded.\n\npredicate : Checks whether a predicate succeeds.\n\nscore (matches | ): Checks whether a score is\nwithin a range (matches), or has a specified comparison to another score. operator can be on of:  =, >.\n\nExamples:\n\nexecute if biome ~ ~ ~ minecraft:snowy\\_taiga ...\nexecute if block 16 -42 83 #minecraft:logs ...\nexecute if blocks ~ ~ ~ ~10 ~10 ~10 0 64 0 all ...\nexecute if data storage example:store path{thing:1} ...\nexecute if dimension minecraft:the\\_end ...\nexecute if entity @e\\[tag=existent] ...\nexecute if function example:my\\_fn ...\nexecute if items entity @s weapon.mainhand #minecraft:swords\\[minecraft:custom\\_data={foo:\"bar\"}] ...\nexecute if loaded 0 0 0 ...\nexecute if predicate example:check ...\nexecute if score @s score = @r score ...\n","url":"/wiki/command/execute/"},{"title":"/data","content":"This page is up to date and validated for the Minecraft version: 1.21\n\n/data command\n\nThe /data command is used to modify and fetch NBT data of blocks, entities and storages.\n\n:::warning\nPlayer data cannot be modified using commands. All subcommands fail when trying to modify player data.\n:::\n\nSubcommands\n\nget \\[path] \\[scale]\n\nGets the data from a data source, and a path, if specified. Multiplies the resulting value by scale, if specified.\nsource is a data source, path is an nbt path and scale is a number.\nIf scale is set, and the data at that path it not a number, the command fails.\n\nAfter fetching the NBT at the path, if it exists, it prints the data in SNBT format in the chat. Therefore, its main use is manually inspecting NBT data. However, it also returns the integer representation of the fetched data, so it can be used in combination with execute store or return run to convert NBT into an integer.\n\nExamples\n\ndata get entity @s SelectedItem.id\ndata get block ~ ~ ~ Items\n\nmerge&#x20;\n\nMerges data with the given data source.\ntarget is a data source and nbt is an SNBT compound.\nThis command fails if the given entity or block does exist, or if the block is not a block entity and cannot hold NBT data. However, if the data source is a storage, and that storage does no exist yet, the storage is automatically created.\n\nExamples\n\ndata merge entity @n\\[type=creeper] {Fuse: 10s, ignited: true, ExplosionRadius: 8}\ndata merge storage example:data {a: 1, b: \"b\", c: \\[41b, 0b]}\n\nmodify&#x20;\n\nModifies the NBT data at the specified path of the given data source. This gives more fine-grained control that data merge.\ntarget is the data source to modify and path is an NBT path, the specific sub-path of that data source.\naction determines what kind of modification occurs. There are 5 possible actions, as below.\nsource determines the source of the data being used to modify the target. See source below.\n\nappend\n\nAppends an NBT value to a list or a typed array, making the value the last element.\nIf the specified path does not exist in the data source, it is created and initialized as a list containing the value just appended.\nThis is equivalent to data modify ... insert 0 ....\n\ninsert&#x20;\n\nInserts an NBT value into a list or array at a specific index, shifting all proceeding elements to the right. Negative indices may be used to indicate inserting values from the end.\nIf the index specified would cause the inserted item to be further than one after the first or last element of the list, the command fails.\nInserting creates list if it doesn't exist in the same way as append.\n\nmerge\n\nMerges source into target at path. This is similar to data merge, but allows modifying a sub-path of a data source, and allows merging from more than just hardcoded NBT values.\n\nprepend\n\nPrepends an NBT value to a list or a typed array, making the value the first element.\nLists are created in the same wat as append.\nThis is equivalent to data modify ... insert -1 ....\n\nset\n\nSets the value of target at path, discarding any previously present value. This will create keys in a compound if not present, but cannot be used to add elements to an array or list, only modify existing ones.\nset can create a chain of nested compounds if they don't already exist.\nFor example, if the storage example:main does not yet exist, after the following command:\n\nThe example:main storage looks like this: {a: {b: {c: {d: 10}}}}.\n\nsource\n\nsource determines the value modifying target. It can be one of:\n\nvalue  - Gets the value from an SNBT literal.\n\nfrom \\[path] - Gets the data from the specified data source and path.\n\nstring \\[path] \\[start] \\[end] - Gets the data from the specified data source and ensures that it's a string. If start or end is specified, truncates the string using those values. start is inclusive, while end is exclusive. Both numbers are allowed to be negative, counting from the end of the string. For example, the indices 1 -1 remove one character from each end of the string, while 0 1 takes the first character.\n\nremove&#x20;\n\nRemoves the NBT data from source at path. source is a data source and path is an NBT path.\nThis deletes compound keys, and removes array and list elements, shifting proceeding elements left. It cannot, however, be used to delete an entire storage using the special {} path; only single keys of the root storage.\n\n:::tip\nIf you would like to be able to remove an entire storage in one go, put all your NBT data in a sub-path of it, for example:\n\n:::\n\nData source\n\nThe place to get data from or store data to. One of:\n\nentity  - The NBT of an entity.\n\nblock  - The NBT of a block entity.\n\nstorage  - The NBT from a data storage.\n\nData merging\n\nData merging is a process of merging two data values into one another.\nThere are two values: The left side and the right side. The left side is the base of the operation, with the right being merged into the left.\n\nIf both sides of the operation are compounds, each key of the right compound is merged into the matching key of the left compound. If the key does not exist in the left compound, it is created and set to the value of the right.\n\nIf both sides are not a compound, the left is simply set to the right.\n","url":"/wiki/command/data/"},{"title":"Target Selectors","content":"This page is validated and up to date with Minecraft Java: 1.21\n\nTarget Selectors\n\nTarget Selectors are used as an argument in commands to select entities and players in the world.

Most datapacks are made primarily of functions - functions are just lists of\ncommands ran in order.\n\nCommand Syntax\n\nMost commands follow this basic syntax:\n\ncommand would refer to the name of the command, and ... would be the arguments that come after the command, changing\nhow it runs.\n\nMinecraft (and this wiki) use these for showing command syntax, to make it easier for you to understand:\n\n| Variable                 | Meaning                                                                            |\n| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|           | An argument.                                                                       |\n| \\[entry]                | An optional entry.                                                                 |\n| \\[entryA│entryB│entryC] | Pick one of these.

Generally, this will be the namespace of your datapack, or the minecraft namespace if interacting with something in the vanilla game. The namespace can contain lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), \\_, - and ..\nThe path defines specific information about the resource location. The path may contain the same characters as the namespace, and additionally /, to separate directories.\nSyntactically, the namespace is separated from the path by a colon (:).\n\nItem IDs are an example of resource locations. The ID minecraft:diamond is a resource location with the namespace minecraft and the path diamond.\n:::tip\nIf the namespace is omitted, it defaults to minecraft, meaning diamond can be used interchangeably with minecraft:diamond.\n:::\n\nEvery file in a datapack has a resource location. It consists of the namespace it resides in, with the path being the path to the file, excluding the directory which determines the file type, so the advancement at example/advancement/subfolder/foo.json would have the resource location example:subfolder/foo, not example:advancement/subfolder/foo.\n\n:::tip\nData storages are identified by resource location. It is considered good practice to name your storages with the namespace of your datapack, and a path which describes the purpose of the storage. This could, for example, correspond to the function which uses it.\n:::\n","url":"/wiki/commands/resource_locations/"},{"title":"Coordinates","content":"This page is validated and up to date with Minecraft Java: 1.21\n\nCoordinates\n\nCoordinates in Minecraft are represented by an x, y, and z value. They are used to represent positions of\nentities, blocks, particles, sounds and more. In commands, they are represented as simply x y z, where x, y, and\nz are decimal numbers representing the coordinates on each axis.\n\nBlock coordinates are locked to the grid and are unique - there can only be one block per set of coordinates. Block\ncoordinates are whole numbers, for example you can have a block at 123 86 94 but not 123.7 86.2 94.6. Entities are\nnot locked to the grid - they can be at decimal positions (and usually are).\n\nx.0 y.0 z.0 represents the bottom left corner of a block, not the centre. The centre of a block would be represented\nby the coordinates x.5 y.5 z.5.\n\n:::info\nEvery command and function in Minecraft is always executed at a position. This is usually the world spawn. You\ncan change this using the commands \"execute at\" or \"execute positioned\".\n:::\n\nExamples\n\n/setblock 123 86 94 minecraft:pink\\_concrete: In this setblock command, we tell the game to put a pink concrete\nblock at the coordinates 123 86 94.\n\n/tp @s 66.2 98 45.7: This command would teleport the current entity to the exact coordinates 66.2 98 45.7\n\nRelative Coordinates\n\nUsing the symbols ~ and ^, we can reference coordinates relative to the current coordinates (for example, you can\nget the position 7 blocks above the current position).\n\n\\~ represents the current position on any axis. For example, 12 ~ 76 would teleport me to x=12 z=76 but keep y\nas the current position. The coordinates ~ ~ ~ would represent the position of the command - this is useful to do\nsomething at the current position such as placing a block or summoning an entity.\n\nThe ~ symbol can be followed by a number to include an offset to the current position. For example, ~ ~12 ~ would\nrepresent the current position offset by 10 blocks on the y-axis (or in simpler terms: the position 10 blocks above\nthe current position). This can also be a negative number.\n\nSimilarly ^ represents a relative position, taking into account the current rotation too. The most common use for this\nis to get a position in front of the direction of rotation. For example, you can use ^ ^ ^5 to get the position 5\nblocks in front of the current position in whatever direction the command or entity is rotated.\n","url":"/wiki/commands/coordinates/"},{"title":"Storages","content":"This page is validated and up to date with Minecraft Java: 1.21\n\nStorages\n\nStorages are a way of storing NBT data in a world without attaching it to an entity or block. Storages are stored globally per world, and can only be manipulated with the /data command. Storages are identified by their resource location, and don't need to be initialized beforehand, unlike scoreboards.\n\nUnlike entity and block NBT, storages have no fixed structure, and can contain whichever arbitrary keys are added to it.\n\nExample\n\nStorages are defined when a /data command modifies them. Unlike scoreboards, storages do not need to be \"created\" - the only code needed to initialize a storage is a /data modify or /data merge command to that storage, for example:\n\nAfter which, if no previous modifications had occurred, the example:main storage would now look like this:\n","url":"/wiki/nbt/storages/"},{"title":"NBT","content":"NBT\n\nSNBT Format\n\nSNBT (Stringified Named Binary Tags) format is a JSON-like tree structure used in datapack development to manipulate the\nNBT data of an entity. SNBT is a human-readable version of NBT (Named Binary Tags), which is a format used by Minecraft\nto store data. NBT is used to store data about entities, items, blocks, structures, game saves, and more.\n\nSNBT consists of key/value pairs, which are represented as key:value. These are contained with compounds,\nmarked with curly brackets ({}). Compounds can contain multiple key/value pairs, which are separated with commas, like\nso: key:value,key:value,key:value\n\nAn example SNBT structure looks like:\n{name:\"Silabear\",age:102,friends:\\[\"Flynecraft\",\"Aandeel\",\"Cobblestone\"],socials:{discord:\"silabear\",twitch:\"silabearr\"}}\n\nData Types\n\nSNBT has a few data types you can use to represent different types of data, including whole numbers, decimal numbers,\nstring, text, booleans, and more.\n\nStrings\n\nStrings can store any text value, or more technically, any sequence of unicode characters.\n\nFormat: Strings are stored within either double or single quotes. For strings containing standard characters\n(A-Z, a-z, 0-9, -,\\_,+,.), the quotes are optional, but recommended. \"\" or ' ' or &#x20;\n\nExample: name:\"Silabear\", name:'Cobblestone', name:Aandeel\n\nWhole Numbers\n\nShort, Int, and Long data types all represent integers (whole numbers).\n\nByte is an unsigned 8 bit integers, it can be any value from 0 to 255\n\nShort is a signed 16 bit integer, it can be any value from -32,768 to 32,767\n\nInt is a signed 32 bit integer, it can be any value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647\n\nLong is a signed 64 bit integer, it can be any value from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to\n9,223,372,036,854,775,807\n\nFormat: By default, numbers are stored as integers. To store a number in the other formats, you need to use the appropriate suffix.\nFor shorts, ints, and longs, the prefix is s, i, and l respectively.\n\nExample: count:1234s, bigNumber:1200000, reallyBigNumber:12123023687234L, byte:112b\n\nDecimal Numbers\n\nFloat and Double data types both represent decimal numbers.\n\nFloat is a signed 32 bit floating point number, it can be any value from -3.4028235E38 to 3.4028235E38. It is precise to 7 decimal places.\n\nDouble is a signed 64 bit floating point number, it can be any value from -1.7976931348623157E308 to\n1.7976931348623157E308. It is precise to 15 decimal places.\n\nFormat: By default, decimal numbers are stored as doubles. To store a number in the other formats, you need to use the\nappropriate suffix. For floats, the suffix is f. For doubles, the suffix is d.\n\nExample: pi:3.1415926535d, e:2.718281828459045d, phi:1.6180f\n\nBytes or Booleans\n\nIn older versions of Minecraft, booleans were stored as bytes with 0b representing\nfalse and 1b representing true. In newer versions, booleans were introduced.\nEssentially, booleans represent the old 0b and 1b with a more descriptive name.\nIt's recommended to use booleans instead of bytes whenever possible, as they are more readable.\n\nArrays\n\nArrays are used to store multiple values of the same type. There are currently 3 types of arrays:\n\nByte Array: Used to store multiple bytes\n\nInt Array: Used to store multiple integers\n\nLong Array: Used to store multiple longs\n\nFormat: Arrays are defined using square brackets (\\[]), followed by the type of the array, a semicolon, and then your data.\nThe data still has to have prefixes if it needs it.\n\nExample: \\[B;1b,2B,true,false], \\[I;1,2,3,4,5], \\[L;1l,2l,3l,4l,5l]\n\nValidator\n\nBelow is a validator for SNBT.

It is the most\npopular of the server softwares as it provides a wide range of plugins and features.\n\nModded: Modded servers are based on the Fabric or Forge, which are mod-based server softwares. They are more\ncustomizable than Bukkit-based servers, but are not as popular. The use of modded servers is still very limited,\nmaking it hard to find a mod for some purposes.\n\nSponge-based: Sponge is a plugin-based server software that is used by many Minecraft servers. It is similar to\nBukkit-based servers, but is more customizable and has support for mods with SpongeForge.\n\nVanilla\n\nThe vanilla server is the most basic server software, and is the one that you get when you download the jar file from\nthe official website. It does not come with mod or plugin support.\nBeyond datapacks, it is not customizable at all.\n\n| Pros                                            | Cons                    |\n| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |\n| Easy to set up                                  | No mod support          |\n| Fastest to update (comes out with every update) | Bad performance         |\n| Designed with exclusively datapacks in mind     | Limited customizations  |\n| No additional bug fixes                         | No additional bug fixes |\n\n:::info\nFor some, a lack of bug fixes can be both positive and negative.

Datapacks are essentially add-ons to Minecraft\nwhich can change the game, whether by adding a simple game mechanic, or creating completely new experiences! The best\npart is that they're really easy to create, even if you have little coding knowledge\n:::\n\nThis guide will help you to create your first datapack, whether you've never tried coding before or if you've got loads\nof experience. The process of coding a datapack is a bit different to other typical programs. By the end of this\ntutorial, you'll have made a simple datapack which makes arrows explode when they land!\n\nGetting Started - Setting up an empty datapack\n\nThe first step when creating a datapack is to make a new world to test it in. Go ahead and do that now - make sure\nthat your world has cheats enabled and it is set to creative mode. Once you've created the world, the next step\nis to find and open your world folder:\n\nSave and quit your world\n\nGo to your world in the Singleplayer menu and hit \"Edit\"\n\nPress \"Open World Folder\"\n\nThis folder opens contains all the data in your Minecraft world. You should see that there's lots of other subfolders in\nthis folder. Find the one which is called datapacks, and open it.\n\nThis folder is where the world's datapacks are stored. Create a folder - this will be the root folder of your datapack\nproject. The name doesn't matter. I'm just going to call it Example Datapack. Open this new folder. Inside this\nfolder is where all the data starts from.\n\n:::tip\nBefore we go further, if you have downloaded and installed Visual Studio Code and the relevant extensions, then\nyou should be able to right click inside the new folder that you created and \"Open in Code\". If not, then no worries, it\nisn't required.\n:::\n\nThe first file we want to create is the pack.mcmeta file. This file will tell Minecraft that the folder is a datapack,\nas well as holding the basic information of the pack. Create pack.mcmeta, and put this inside it:\n\nIf you're interested, here's what this file means:\n\npack is an object containing the metadata of the file.\n\ndescription is the name of your datapack, usually along with a short description of what your pack does.\n\npack\\_format tells Minecraft what versions this datapack works in. 48 is the latest for 1.21\n\nWriting your first function\n\n:::info\nWhat are functions? In short, functions are the majority of what makes up most datapacks. A function is a file\ncontaining Minecraft commands. When a function is ran, every command in the function is ran in order. Functions are\nalways ran as an entity (or as the Server) and at a position\n:::\n\nLet's get started by writing one simple function. In\ntraditional programming function, let's make a function to show you \"Hello World\" when it is ran.\n\nCreate a folder in your datapack called data.\n\nIn the data folder, create a new folder. This folder is your namespace - it will contain all the data specific\nto your datapack. Usually this needs to have a unique name (one which other people would not have picked), but\nfor this tutorial just call it example.\n\nIn the example folder, create a folder called function. This folder will contain all the mcfunction files.\n\nYou should now have a folder structure that looks something like this:\n\n:::warning\nIn versions earlier than 1.21, the function folder should be called functions, due to some pesky name changes\nMojang introduced in a recent update.\n:::\n\nOnce you're sure that's correct, you can start writing the actual function.\n\nIn the function folder, create an empty file called hello\\_world.mcfunction. Open this file with any text editor (we\nrecommend Visual Studio Code)\n\nInside hello\\_world.mcfunction, put the following:\n\nIt's that simple! Once you save that file, rejoin your world and then run /reload, you should be able to use\nthe following command to run the function:\n\nWhat's next?\n\nNow you know how to create a basic function and run it, we'll next start to think about how to create our project. For\nmore advanced projects, this can sometimes be the most difficult part. Luckily for us, what we want to create won't be\ntoo difficult.\n\nLet's break down the idea into smaller steps. Remember, we want to create a datapack which makes arrows explode.\n\nDetect when an arrow lands on the ground. We can do this by running a command on a loop which will select any\narrow on the ground and then run a function.\n\nCreate an explosion. This is as simple as summoning a TNT at the position of the arrow.\n\nRemove the arrow. If you don't do this, then it will keep on exploding forever.\n\nThe next steps of this guide will guide you through the typical process of each of those steps.\n\nRunning functions on a loop\n\nThe first step on our list is to detect arrows which land on the ground. To do this, we need to run a command on a loop.\nLuckily, Minecraft makes this pretty easy for us.\n\nFirstly, let's make the function which you want to run on a loop. In the function folder, create a new mcfunction\nfile - call this one loop.mcfunction.\n\nFor now, let's just make it say \"Hi\" every time it loops. You can do this by putting this in the new function:\n\nTo make this function run on a loop, we need to create a JSON file which tells Minecraft \"run this command every tick\"\n(every tick = 20 times per second)\n\nIn the data folder, create the minecraft folder.\n\nIn the minecraft folder, create a tags folder\n\nIn the tags folder, create a function folder\n\nIn the new function folder, create a new file: tick.json\n\ntick.json is NOT a function. In tick.json, we are going to put a list of functions which we want to run\nevery tick. If you put any commands in tick.json, it will break your pack.\n\nIn tick.json, put the following:\n\nvalues is a list of function references which will be run on a loop.\n\nexample:loop is a reference to the loop.mcfunction file we created earlier. example refers to the namespace (the\nfolder in data), and loop refers to the mcfunction file name.\n\nIf you save this file, go back to your world, and run /reload, you should see that the chat is being spammed with \"Hi\"\nover and over again!\n\nSelecting the arrows\n\nNow we've created a function which will run infinitely on a loop, we can move on to detecting when an arrow is in the\nground.\n\nAs far as the game is concerned, an arrow is an enity, just like a pig, cow or zombie. Minecraft gives us a special\nway to select any types of entities with target selectors. Once we've selected an\nentity, we can use the /execute command to run a command as the entity.\n\nWe can use these to select all arrows which are in the ground, and then run a command to make them explode (and then\nremove themselves).\n\nAs mentioned, to select an entity, we need to use a target selectors. I'm going to teach you a bit about target\nselectors. You should pay attention here, but if you only want the code, scroll past this section.\n\nWhat are target selectors?\n\nTarget selectors are a special bit of code we can use to find an entity in the world. They all start with an @ symbol.\nThere are 6 base target selectors:\n\n| Target Selector | Description                                                                                                                                                                |\n| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| @e              | All Entities - By itself, this selector will select every single entity which is currently loaded in the world                                                         |\n| @s              | This Entity - This selector will select the entity which is currently running the command. For example, if I run a command as @s, then it will run the commands as me. |\n| @a              | All Players - This selects all currently online players. (All players are always loaded in the world).                                                                 |\n| @r              | Random Player - This selects one random player.                                                                                                                        |\n| @p              | Nearest Player - This selects the nearest player to the position this command is ran from.                                                                             |\n| @n              | Nearest Entity - This selects the nearest entity (player or non-player) to the position this command is ran from.                                                      |\n\nOn it's own, a base target selector (like in the table) does not do much. We can narrow down the selection even more by\nusing criteria. Criteria are put in square brackets after the base selector.\n\nFor example, we can use @e with a type criteria to select all entities of a certain type - for example,\n@e\\[type=minecraft:cow] would select all cow entities.\n\nI'm not going to explain every single criteria you can use - you can view a list\nhere. These are the basic ones which you might see quite often:\n\n| Criteria                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| \\[type=minecraft:arrow] | Entity Type - This criteria will narrow down the selection to only include entities of a certain type. For good pack optimisation, you should use this often.                                                                                                |\n| \\[distance=..5]         | Distance to entity - This criteria will only include entities based on their distance to their distance to the current position. .. can be used to represent a greater/less than symbol - for example, ..5 means less than 5 blocks away.                |\n| \\[limit=2]              | Limit selection - Using the limit criteria, you can make specify a max amount of entities to be selected. This is often used in conjunction with the sort criteria. For example, @e\\[sort=nearest,limit=1] would select the nearest entity of any type. |\n| \\[nbt={key:value}]      | Entity Data - This criteria will select entities if their NBT (entity data) matches a pattern.                                                                                                                                                               |\n\nHow are we going to use them?\n\nWe can use these selectors to only select arrows which are in the ground. We can select all arrows with\n@e\\[type=arrow], but this will also include arrows in the air. To select arrows in the ground, we can check if they\nhave the data {inGround:1b}, so we would use @e\\[type=arrow,nbt={inGround:1b}]\n\nThis target selector can be used in an execute command to run a command as the entity. Try putting this in your\nloop.mcfunction:\n\nReload your datapack and fire an arrow at at a block. You should see that your chat is spammed with messages, meaning\nthat we successfully selected arrows in the ground, and executed a command as them!\n\nMake it go boom\n\nNow we can move onto the fun part! We have a simple command which will run another command as any arrow in the ground.\nWe only need to do two things with this command:\n\nSpawn an explosion at the position of the arrow\n\nKill the arrow so that it only explodes once\n\nTo create an explosion in Minecraft, we can simply summon a TNT entity. When a TNT entity is summoned, it will explode\ninstantly.\n\nThen, we just need to copy this command and make it kill the arrow after the explosion has happened. This is as simple\nas it sounds - we can use /kill to remove the arrow. Your finished loop.mcfunction should look like this:\n\n:::info\nIn reality, this method isn't the best one to use. Instead of having two commands for this, you can just execute\na function as the arrow which will summon the TNT at @s's position, and then kill @s. By only using the @e selector once\nand then referring to @s, you remove extra stress from the computer. For now, it doesn't matter - this guide is designed\nto give you a better idea of the logic rather than the little details\n:::\n\nYou're done! Once you /reload your pack, you should be free to play around with a simple exploding arrows datapack\nwhich you made with the help of this tutorial.

In\nthat case, change the sound\\_id in the example\\_jukebox\\_song.json file from the datapack to the sounds ID. (for\nexample: \"sound\\_id\": \"minecraft:music\\_disc.cat\").\n\nIf you don't want to use a default Minecraft sound, then a resource pack is required to add the custom sound (in this\ncase, the music on the disc) to Minecraft, so that the datapack can read it.\n\n:::info\nMinecraft handles sound in .ogg files. There are many different converters you can use to convert an MP3, WAV,\nor other audio file to .ogg.\n:::\n\nYou need to add your .ogg file (the audio of your music disc) to assets/ /sounds/.ogg. Make sure\nthat   and   are the same values you put in the datapack's JSON file (the\nexample\\_jukebox\\_song.json file in our case).\n\nThen, if you haven't already, you need to create a sounds.json file at the position assets/ /sounds.json.\nThis file tells Minecraft what audio files map to what IDs. Put this inside:\n\nSee it in action\n\nOnce you save the above files, you need to activate the resource pack, and reload it with the keybind F3 + T\nin-game.

The second method is for all version\nbefore 1.20.5.\n\nAfter 1.20.5\n\nThis is the easier method of the two, only requiring you to put the item id and components into the recipe output.\n\n:::info\nNote that there is currently no way to specify item components in the recipe's input items, only in the result.\nMeaning your custom item can't (easily) be crafted out of different custom items.\n:::\n\nThe instructions here will be very simple, requiring you to only create one file, that being the actual crafting recipe\nfile. This file can be named whatever, but has to end in the .json file format.\n\nHere is an example of a recipe with the output of a custom item:\n\nIn the example, you can see that the result has a \"components\" field, where you can list the components that your\ncustom item should have. I can also recommend a useful site for generating recipes with specified components:\nhttps://misode.github.io/recipe/\n\nBefore 1.20.5\n\nThis part of the guide assumes that you already knowledge some basic commands and how crafting recipes and\nadvancements work.\n\nTo create a crafting recipe for one of your custom items, you need just a little bit more than for a normal recipe. This\nis because of the fact that you couldn't use NBT in recipes before 1.20.5 dropped, so that's why we need a small\nworkaround.\n\nLets create the recipe first:\n\nAs mentioned before, we can't use the custom item as output, so we use the knowledge book as a placeholder.\n\nTo switch the knowledge book with our custom item, we need an advancement to react when we craft the recipe. For this we\nuse the recipe\\_crafted trigger. With some trickery, here it is also possible to make the ingredients require certain\nnbt.\n\nLastly we have to make the actual function that handles the item switching.

Code will almost never\nwork the first time you try it. An error in your code is referred to as a bug. Removing these bugs is called debugging.\nThis guide will teach you the best methods for debugging datapacks.\n\nWhat are bugs?\n\nBugs are a fancy programmer term for an error in your code. There are two main types of bugs:\n\nSyntax error: This is a bug in the actual written code. This is caused by the code you write being incorrectly\nwritten so that the computer literally can't read it. For example, writing executr as @a would be a syntax error\nbecause executr isn't a command.\n\nLogic error: This is a bug where the written code is correctly written, but the code doesn't do what you want it\nto. This is caused by a mistake in the code logic. In the simplest example, if you want to give a player 32 diamonds,\nbut you accidentally wrote 322.\n\nFinding and debugging syntax errors\n\nSyntax errors are pretty easy to spot and fix, due to Minecraft's output logs, which literally tell you if your code is\nincorrect. When you're coding datapacks, its a good idea to always have the logs open if you need to double check it.\nYou can open the logs by opening the default Minecraft launcher and clicking \"Settings\", and then enabling \"Open output\nlog when Minecraft: Java Edition starts\", then just starting the game.\n\nA guide on how to open the Minecraft launchers output logs\n\nSyntax errors will show up in red text when you /reload your datapack. But sometimes other errors can also show in\nyellow text instead.\n\nLets take this image as an example: Output log with an error. Here, the\nerror tells you exactly where the error is - in this case it's in the function \"be:give\" at line 1 after \".... give @s\".\nAnd indeed I did spell \"loot\" as \"lot\", which caused the error.\nCode with a syntax error\n\nFinding logic errors\n\nLogic errors are more difficult to find because there's nothing actually incorrect with the code you wrote, it just does\nsomething other than what you want it to do.\n\nAn easy way to find where a logic error is in the code is to make use of the say or tellraw command. These commands\nwill send any message to the chat, making it easy for you to know when and if your code actually runs as you\nexpect it to. You can easily put a say Function ran correctly command in your function - If the\nfunction runs, then it will send a message to the chat. It will also send the name of the entity that ran the\nfunction to the chat, so you can see if your function is executed by the correct entity.\n\nSimilarly, you can use the tellraw command for more advanced debugging. The tellraw command also has the capability to\nshow you the value of scoreboards and NBT values, so you can check what data your code is using. For instance, if you\nwant to check the value of a scoreboard, you could use the following command:\n\nBased on the output of these commands in chat, you can use this to tell where your code goes wrong. (Just make sure to\nremove them after you've found the error, otherwise it can get annoying).\n\nYou may want to keep the debug messages in the datapack, but you don't want it to be sent to every player. Fortunately\nfor us, with the tellraw command, you can specify to who the message will be sent. This means you could only send the\ndebug messages to those who have the tag debug:\n\nDebugging logic errors\n\nUnfortunately, debugging logic errors in your code isn't as easy as fixing one spelling mistake. But yet there are still\ntechniques that we can use.\n\nOne way to solve logic errors is to recreate the error in a separate project. When you remove all the other context of\nthe pack, you can focus just on the bit which doesn't work. You can just copy out the code you want to fix into a\nseparate datapack, then fix it there. Once you've identified and fixed the problem, you'll know how to fix it in the\nreal project.\n\nSummary\n\nThe first main method for debugging datapacks is using Minecraft's output logs, we've already learnt how to use those in\nthe first part of this guide. The second method is using the in-game commands, like /say and /tellraw to print\ninformation in real-time about how your datapack works. But those are not the only ones, you can use the\n/scoreboard objectives setdisplay  command to show the values of a scoreboard on your screen in real-time,\nor you can use /data get ..., which will print the value of any NBT data in chat.\n\nA scoreboard on screen\n\nYou might also find that some other methods that suit you the best, for example you might find the\nData Reload mod useful for displaying errors in chat, or a completely different\nmethod, that is up to you.\n","url":"/guide/technical/debugging/"},{"title":"Player ID System","content":"This page is validated and up to date with Minecraft Java: 1.21\n\nGive each player a unique ID\n\nCreate a scoreboard in a load function that runs on /reload\n\nCreate a function to assign a unique id to the player\n\nCreate a tick advancement to assign an id to a player when they first join\n\nCheck if an entity has the same ID as the player\n\nCreate a predicate that compares the id\n\nTo use it in a function, you can do that following\n","url":"/guide/technical/player-id-system/"},{"title":"Raycasts","content":"This page is validated and up to date with Minecraft Java: 1.21\n\nRaycasting\n\nRaycasting is when we shoot a line from the player's eyes in the direction they are looking. We use this to get what the\nplayer is looking at and do something to it, such as spawning an explosion.\n\n:::info\nThis tutorial uses a neat thing called a recursive function. A recursive function is a function that\nruns itself over and over again.\n:::\n\nRaycast to an entity\n\nThis method will show you how to find what entity that a player is looking at. This is useful for many reasons - if you\nwanted to make a gun datapack, you'd need to damage the entity that a player is looking at in order to damage them.\n\nTo do this, you have to run a recursive function which will start at the eyes of the player and keep running itself\n0.1 blocks forward until it hits an entity. When it does hit an entity, you can easily get the entity and do\nsomething to it.\n\nFirstly, we'll make the function which, when you run it, will start the raycast. In this function, we'll want to:\n\nset the maximum distance for the raycast, so it won't go on forever if it never hits an entity.\n\nrun the function at the eyes of the player\n\nTo set a maximum distance, we store the maximum amount of times we want the function to run in a scoreboard. Every time\nthe recursive function runs, we want to subtract one from that scoreboard, and only continue if the score is more\nthan 0.\n\nFirst, you need to create a scoreboard in your load function.\n\nThen, we can use this scoreboard to set the limit of the raycast before we run it (In this case we set it to 1000 which\nis 100 blocks. 1000 steps \\* 0.1 blocks/step = 100 blocks).\n\nWe also tag the entity executing the raycast so we can exclude it later for hit detection.\n\nCall The raycasts function one step further in the facing direction.\n\nRemove the tag at the end of the function so it does not interfere with other raycasts that might be executed within the\nsame tick.\n\nIn the raycast function, we want to check if the function has hit an entity, and if not, run it again until it does, hit\na wall, or reaches the raycasts limit, moving a bit forward each time.\n\nWe first decrement the limit value by 1.\n\nThen we make the path of the raycast visible by summoning a few particles. Instead of summoning particles, it could also\nrun another function for more complex behavior.\n\nThe next step is a bit more complex. We execute a command as every entity that is not the caster and whose hit box\nintersects with the two differently offset\nvirtual volumes. Near the end you see\nunless function :hit this will run the function as the hit entity and, because all functions without a\nreturn command return false and we check for unless, this condition resolves to true and will return with the number\n0, ending the raycast. Should no entity be in both volumes and the function doesn't get run, the return command at the\nend won't be reached and the raycast will continue.\n\nThe last command checks if the raycast hit a wall. If it does, the raycast will end. If it doesn't, it will then check\nif the limit is reached, again ending if it is. Should the limit not be reached yet, it will move 0.1 blocks forward and\ncall the raycast function again (recursion).\n","url":"/guide/technical/raycasts/"},{"title":"Slowcast","content":"This page is validated and up to date with Minecraft Java: 1.21\n\nSlowcasting\n\nA Slowcast is similar to a raycast, but unlike a standard Raycast, it is not instant.\n\nIn some cases it is enough to use a simple tp command that teleports a marker a bit forward every tick. If you wanted it\nto move faster, however, you have to increase the distance it teleports and this could result in skipping over entities\nor blocks you might want to detect.\n\nA slowcast solves this problem by teleporting multiple times within a single tick to travel faster but still checking if\nit hits something on its way.\n\n:::info\nThis tutorial uses a thing called a recursive function. A recursive function is a function that runs\nitself over and over again.\n:::\n\nSlowcasting to an entity\n\nThis method shows you how you can create and shoot a slowcast to detect entities on its way.\n\nSlowcasts can be useful if you want to create fast but not instantaneous moving projectiles for magic spells for\nexample.\n\nTo make a slowcast, you need:\n\nset up a projectile with all the data it needs\n\na duration function to manage the travel distance\n\na step function that teleports the projectile and checks if it hit something\n\na temporary loop that calls the step function for all active projectiles.\n\nLet's start by creating all the necessary scoreboards in the load function.\n\nThe next step is to initialize the projectile. This is done by running the following function as and at the player. It\nsummons a new marker entity (any other entity works too) and runs the setup function as that entity.\n\nSadly it is not possible to add nbt data in the summon sub-command so we have to add it in the setup function too. We\nwill give it a tag that marks it as a slowcast projectile. After that, we set all the scores it needs to function\nproperly. In this example, you will see that instead of setting the scores directly it copies from temporary\nscoreboards. This is so that the values are not hardcoded and can be different for different projectiles without having\nto create a new setup function for each projectile. At the end, we then call the temporary loop function.\n\nThe projectile is all set up and the loop function is called. The loop function is the part of this whole system that\nkeeps everything running as long as there are active slowcast projectiles.\n\nNow the actual slowcast logic which handles the movement, travel distance, and hit detection.\n\nIn the looping function the duration function is called, let's make this one first. This function is responsible for the\nslowcasts travel distance and calling the step function for the actual movement.\n\ndecrease the duration score\n\nstores the projectile step count in a temporary scoreboard\n\ncalls the step function 0.2 blocks further in the facing direction\n\nkill the projectile should it have a distance score of below 1 at the end of the function\n\nIn the called step function we handle the teleportation between the current and target position and check if the\nprojectile has hit something on its way there.\n\ndecrement the step score in the temporary scoreboard (we still need the step score stored in the projectile for the\nnext time we call the step function)\n\nmake some particles for the visuals (you could replace the particle command with another function call that does more\ncomplex stuff)\n\nexecute a command as every entity (excluding entities with the slowcast tag and players) whose hit box intersects\nwith both virtual volumes run the hit\nfunction and kill the projectile.\n\ntp the projectile to the current position (until now it only executed the command at this position but is still 0.1\nblock further back)\n\nexecute this function again one 0.1 block step forward should the temporary step counter still be over 1\n(recursion)\n\nThe hit function called in the hit detection does whatever you want it to do when hitting an entity. It could spawn an\nexplosion, apply an effect, or simply deal some damage.\n:::tip\nWhen you make the hit function have a successful return\nvalue, it will not kill the projectile in the step function. You could use this to make a piercing projectile for\nexample.\n:::\n","url":"/guide/technical/slowcasts/"},{"title":"Generating Random Numbers","content":"This page is validated and up to date with Minecraft Java: 1.21\n\nGenerating Random Numbers using Datapacks!\n\nGenerating a random number is very useful in programming for a variety of reasons, so lets learn how to do it with a\ndatapack!

We like to be consistent, so please read through this section carefully and use these features to\nyour advantage:\n\nBasic formatting\n\nAll content on the website (except navbar, sidebar and things that are not the actual wiki pages) are made using a\ntechnology called mdsvex. This technology enables people like you to insert Markdown along with\nsvelte components.\n\nEach page is made of 3 parts:\n\nfront matter (metadata about the page such as title, description, tags, versions, etc.)\n\ncontent (the actual content of the page)\n\ncomponents (custom components that allow for interactivity or other features not able to be reproduced with markdown)\n\nEach is crucial to making the page look and feel how it does.\n\nAlong with everything else, there is also a component called Version which is used to display the Minecraft version the page is validated and up to date with.\n\nThis page is validated and up to date with Minecraft Java: 1.21\n\nWe recommend using this component on any page that is validated and up to date with the latest Minecraft version.\n\n:::tip\nIt is recommended to know what the proper way to format markdown is in order to stay consistent and prevent confusion.\nIf you don't know it off by heart, try taking some of the recommendations from a program like Markdown Lint.\n:::\n\nFront Matter\n\nWe try to keep the front matter as minimal as possible, but it is still required to be present. Without it, the page will not display correctly on search engines or other sites.\nFront matter may seem daunting, but it is quite simple. The front matter for this page looks like this:\n\nThe title should be the same as the title in the sidebar in order to reduce confusion. The description should be a\nshort summary of the content of the page in order to show people what all is covered in the article. Some old pages\nmight not have a description or the description may be the first line on the page. In many cases this is not optimal,\nso we recommend changing description field to provide a more detailed description of the page.\n\nCustom Elements\n\nOur markdown system adds unlimited customizability to the way we format our pages. As of the time of writing, we currently have the following features:\n\nAdmonitions\n\nCode Titles\n\nHighlighting (WIP MCFunction Highlighting)\n\nAdmonitions are a way to add a colored box to your page. They are used to highlight important information, warnings, tips, etc.\n\n:::info\nThis is an example of an info box.\n:::\n\nCode titles are a way to add a title to a code block. They are used to make it easier to read code blocks.\n\nHighlighting is a way to highlight specific text in a code block. It is used to make it easier to read code blocks.\n\nStandardized Elements\n\nAs of right now, the wiki uses a few elements that are standardized across the entire wiki. Right now this only consists of command syntax.\nYou can find the command syntax we use in the commands page.\n\nFormatting Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate basic markdown formatting and some custom elements and markdown features.
