We like to be consistent, so please read through this section carefully\nand use these features to your advantage:\n\nBasic Writing Guidelines\n\nWhen writing for the wiki, write in a way that is easy to understand and easy for beginners to understand. Put\nyourself in the viewer's shoes. What confused you when you first learned about the topic? What new terms did you learn?\nAvoid using technical terms without explaining them or point to a resource that explains them.\n\nDocumentation and tutorials are a great way to learn, but sometimes you don't need to read every part of a page to\nunderstand it. When writing for the wiki, write in a way that makes it easy to scan and understand quickly. Some\nrecommendations are using white space to your advantage to break your page into easily digestible chunks.\n\nWhen learning a concept, it is helpful to have concrete examples that people can refer to instead of\njust using a concept. This will help wiki-goers understand the concept better and make it easier to remember.\n\nWriting Style\n\nThe datapacking community is a diverse group of people with different backgrounds; many people don't speak English as\ntheir first language!\n\nWhen writing, try to follow these guidelines:\n\nUse the active voice. For example, instead of The player can use the command, write Players can use the command.\nDon't use unnecessary adverbs or adjectives\nDon't use the words: obvious, simple, basic, easy, actual, just, clear, and however\nExplicitly reference what you are explaining\nUse 's for indicating possession\nUse the Oxford comma\n\nTechnical information\n\nAll content on the website (except a few small exceptions) are made using a technology called mdsvex. This technology\nenables people like you to insert Markdown with svelte components.\n\nIt is recommended to know what the proper way to format Markdown is in order to stay consistent and prevent confusion.\n\nThe front matter title is the same as the title in the sidebar and the title on the page (heading 1 or single\n#)\nUse bold and italics sparingly and only when emphasis is needed\nUse headings to break up the page into sections\nCode blocks are used to show code snippets or commands\nAdmonitions are used to show important information unrelated to the content of the page\nTables are used to show large amounts of data\n\n\nMany markdown formatters do not work well with admonitions. We recommend manually formatting whenever\npossible. Break up lines to make it easier to read in the source and on the page.\n\nKeep lines under 100 characters.\n\n\nEach page is made of 3 parts:\n\nfront matter (metadata about the page such as title, description, tags, version, etc.)\ncontent (the actual content of the page)\ncomponents (custom components that allow for interactivity or other features not able to be reproduced with markdown)\n\nEach is crucial to making the page look and feel how it does.\n\nFrontmatter\n\nWe try to keep the front matter as minimal as possible, but it is still required. Without it, the page\nwill not display correctly on search engines or other sites. The front matter for this page looks like\nthis:\n\ntitle: \"Site Development\"\ndescription: \"This page is meant to be an introduction to formatting a page for the wiki. In it is multiple examples which you can examine raw in the site source code.\"\nversion: 1.21.4\n\nFront matter is denoted with triple hyphens (---) at the top of the page and the end of the front matter.\nThe title should be the same as the title in the sidebar in order to reduce confusion. \nThe description should be a short summary of the content of the page in order to show people what all is covered in the article. \nThe version should be set to the latest version that the page has been and works in. If the page works in 1.21.4 but not in 1.21.5 or later, this should be set to 1.21.4.\n\nCustom Elements\n\nOur markdown system adds unlimited customizability to the way we format our pages. As of the time of writing, we have the following features:\n\nAdmonitions\nCode Titles\nMCFunction Formatting (Thanks Snave!)\nHighlighting\n\nAdmonitions are a way to warnings, info or tips, or other important information to your page.\n\n:::info\nThis is an example of an info box.\n:::\n\n:::info\nThis is an example of an info box.\n:::\n\nCode blocks are a way to format code in your page. These code blocks come with the option to add a title to the code\nblock for clarity. The Datapack Wiki supports syntax highlighting for MCFunction which are used for code samples\nwhenever possible.\n\nfunction example() {\nconsole.log(\"Hello World!\");\n}\n\nHighlighting is a way to highlight specific text. It isn't commonly used, but exists.\n\nHighlighted Text like this.\n\nStandardized Elements\n\nThe wiki uses a few elements that are standardized across the entire wiki. Right now this only consists\nof command syntax. You can find the command syntax we use in the commands page.","description":"This page is an introduction to formatting page content, and details about how the wiki handles formatting.","url":"/contribute/formatting/","tags":[]},{"title":"Git Practices","content":"Git Practices\n\nLast Updated: 12-13-2024\n\nThis page is an introduction to how we use Git in the wiki repository. In order to keep the wiki consistent and\nreputable, we have a few rules that we follow.\n\nGit provides a lot of features that are great for collaboration, and we try to use them as much as possible.\n\nBranching and PRs\n\nBranches are a great way to work on the wiki without introducing unfinished pages, changes, etc. Branches allow you to\nwork on a page without affecting the main (production) branch and allow us to review your changes before they are\nmerged.\n\nBranch Naming\n\nWe use kebab-case for branch names meaning the branch name should be all lowercase with hyphens to\nseparate words. For example, if you are working on a page called \"Adding New Features\", the branch name should be\nadding-new-features.\n\nBranch Workflow\n\nWhen you are ready to merge your changes into the main branch, create a pull request (PR) and assign it to a\nreviewer. The reviewer will review your changes and either approve or request changes. Once approved, the changes will\nbe merged into the main branch.\n\nWe recommend deleting the branch after it has been merged into the main branch. This will keep the repository clean and\nreduce confusion. An exception to this is if you are working on a very large feature that will take a while to merge, or\nif you plan to merge multiple features from one branch.\n\nForking\n\nForking is another way to work on the wiki without affecting the main branch. This is useful if you are a first-time\ncontributor and don't have write access. You can click the \"Fork\" button in the top right corner of the repository to\ncreate a fork of the repository. This will create a copy of the repository that you can work on.\n\nOnce you have forked the repository, you can clone it to your local machine.\n\nWhen it comes time to merge your changes, you can create a pull request in the same way as you would with a branch, just\nreplace the branch name with the name of your fork's branch name.\n\nCommit Messages\n\nCommit messages are a great way to keep track of what changes have been made to the wiki. Summarize the changes in the\ncommit message and use the imperative mood.\n\nFor example, if you are adding a new page called \"Adding New Features\", the commit message should be\nAdd new page for adding new features. If you are fixing a typo on a page, the commit message could be\nFix typo in page about adding new features.\n\nOptionally, you can add a short description of the changes in the commit message. This is not required, but it is\nrecommended.\n\nMerging\n\nWhenever you start working on a new branch or features, pull the latest changes from the main branch. This\nwill ensure that you have the most up-to-date changes.\n\nYou will likely run into an issue with the search.json file, which is used to generate the search index. This file is\ngenerated automatically and should not be manually edited. A solution to this is to remove the search.json file and\nrun the search index generation script. This will regenerate the file and you can commit it.\n\nnode run ./gen_search_indexes_node.js\n\nOR\n\nbun ./gen_search_indexes.js\n\nOther Important Information\n\nAlways use the main branch as the base branch for your PRs. This will reduce the chances of conflicts and ensure\nthat your changes are merged correctly.\nMake a description of your changes in your PR.\nReviewers: Proofread changes before approving them.\nReviewers: It's not required, but it's recommended the changes follow American English for consistency sake.","description":"This page is an introduction to our Git practices a page for the wiki.","url":"/contribute/git-practices/","tags":[]},{"title":"Player ID System","content":"Player ID System\nThis guide will explain how to create a player ID system within a datapack. A player ID system gives each player a unique score on a scoreboard, which can then be used to link players to entities, or for the player to be able to select another player easily.\n\nAssigning player IDs\nFirstly, we need to create a scoreboard objective to store the players' IDs. This scoreboard needs a fake player in order to store the maximum ID value so that no two players end up with the same ID.\n\nCreate the playerid scoreboard\nscoreboard objectives add playerid dummy\n\nSet the max score on the playerid scoreboard to 1, unless already set\nexecute unless score .max playerid matches 1.. run scoreboard players set .max playerid 1\n\nNext, we need to assign an ID to the player when they first join the world.

This function will return all the entities with the same ID as the executor:\n\nSet #this to the current entity's ID\nscoreboard players operation #this playerid = @s playerid\n\nFind all entities which have the same ID\nexecute as @e[predicate= :match_id] run say I have the same ID.\n`","description":"Create a player ID system in a Minecraft datapack for linking players to entities.","url":"/guide/nbt-and-scores/player-id-system/","tags":[]},{"title":"Array Iteration","content":"Array Iteration\nArray Iteration allows us to loop through an array and do something with each item individually (for example, add every item in an array, output each array item individually, modify all elements in an array, combine strings in an array, etc.)\n\nMethod\nFor this guide, imagine our array is defined with the following:\ndata modify storage minecraft:example ExampleArray set value [\"Array Item 1\", \"Array Item 2\", \"Array Item 3\"]\n\nThe steps to iterate through the array are:\nStore the length of the array in a score\nDo something with the first element in the array (array[0]) - you can either just read the element, or modify it\nCopy the first element to the end of the array, then remove the first element.\nDecrease the length score by 1\nIf the length score is 1 or more, repeat from step 2 until it isn't\n\nFirst, we need a function which will begin the process.

It now only requires a single\ncommand:\n\nexecute store result ... run random value 1..10\n\nIn the command you can change the values 1 and 10 to change the range.

If you wanted it\nto move faster, however, you have to increase the distance it teleports and this could result in skipping over entities\nor blocks you might want to detect.\n\nA slowcast solves this problem by teleporting multiple times within a single tick to travel faster but still checking if\nit hits something on its way.\n\n\nThis tutorial uses a thing called a recursive function. A recursive function is a function that runs\nitself over and over again.\n\n\nSlowcasting to an entity\n\nThis method shows you how you can create and shoot a slowcast to detect entities on its way.\n\nSlowcasts can be useful if you want to create fast but not instantaneous moving projectiles for magic spells for\nexample.\n\nTo make a slowcast, you need:\n\nset up a projectile with all the data it needs\na duration function to manage the travel distance\na step function that teleports the projectile and checks if it hit something\na temporary loop that calls the step function for all active projectiles.\n\nLet's start by creating all the necessary scoreboards in the load function.\n\nscoreboard objectives add temp dummy\nscoreboard objectives add slowcast.steps dummy\nscoreboard objectives add slowcast.duration dummy\n\nThe next step is to initialize the projectile. This is done by running the following function as and at the player. It\nsummons a new marker entity (any other entity works too) and runs the setup function as that entity.\n\nexecute anchored eyes positioned ^ ^ ^.3 summon minecraft:marker run function :setup\n\nSadly it is not possible to add nbt data in the summon sub-command so we have to add it in the setup function too. We\nwill give it a tag that marks it as a slowcast projectile. After that, we set all the scores it needs to function\nproperly. In this example, you will see that instead of setting the scores directly it copies from temporary\nscoreboards. This is so that the values are not hardcoded and can be different for different projectiles without having\nto create a new setup function for each projectile. At the end, we then call the temporary loop function.\n\ntag @s add slowcast\n\nscoreboard players operation @s slowcast.steps = maxSteps temp\nscoreboard players operation @s slowcast.duration = duration temp\n\nfunction :temp_tick\n\nThe projectile is all set up and the loop function is called.

This function is responsible for the\nslowcasts travel distance and calling the step function for the actual movement.\n\ndecrease the duration score\nstores the projectile step count in a temporary scoreboard\ncalls the step function 0.2 blocks further in the facing direction\nkill the projectile should it have a distance score of below 1 at the end of the function\n\nscoreboard players remove @s slowcast.duration 1\n\nscoreboard players operation steps temp = @s slowcast.steps\nexecute positioned ^ ^ ^.1 run function :step\n\nexecute unless score @s slowcast.duration matches 1.. run kill\n\nIn the called step function we handle the teleportation between the current and target position and check if the\nprojectile has hit something on its way there.\n\ndecrement the step score in the temporary scoreboard _(we still need the step score stored in the projectile for the\nnext time we call the step function)_\nmake some particles for the visuals (you could replace the particle command with another function call that does more\ncomplex stuff)\nexecute a command as every entity (excluding entities with the slowcast tag and players) whose hit box intersects\nwith both virtual volumes run the hit\nfunction and kill the projectile.\ntp the projectile to the current position _(until now it only executed the command at this position but is still 0.1\nblock further back)_\nexecute this function again one 0.1 block step forward should the temporary step counter still be over 1\n(recursion)\n\nscoreboard players remove steps temp 1\n\nparticle flame   ~ .1 .1 .1 0 1\n\nexecute as @e[type=!player,type=!marker,dx=0] positioned -.99 -.99 -.99 if entity @s[dx=0] positioned .99 .99 .99 unless function :hit run kill @n[tag=slowcast]\n\ntp   ~\n\nexecute if score slowcast.steps temp matches 1.. positioned ^ ^ ^.1 run function :step\n\nThe hit function called in the hit detection does whatever you want it to do when hitting an entity.

We use this to get what the\nplayer is looking at and do something to it, such as spawning an explosion.\n\n\nThis tutorial uses a neat thing called a recursive function. A recursive function is a function that runs itself over and over again.\n\n\nThis method works due to a special behaviour of Minecraft functions - functions are always run at a position and rotation. THis means that we can run a function at a postition, move it forward in the direction, and run it again, over and over again. This is how we can make a raycast.\n\nMethod\nThis method will show you how to find what entity that a player is looking at. This is useful for many reasons - if you wanted to make a gun datapack, you'd need to damage the entity that a player is looking at in order to damage them.\n\nTo do this, you have to run a recursive function which will start at the eyes of the player and keep running itself\n0.1 blocks forward until it hits an entity. When it does hit an entity, you can easily get the entity and do\nsomething to it.\n\nFirstly, we'll make the function which, when you run it, will start the raycast. In this function, we'll want to:\n\nset the maximum distance for the raycast, so it won't go on forever if it never hits an entity.\nrun the function at the eyes of the player\n\nTo set a maximum distance, we store the maximum amount of times we want the function to run in a scoreboard. Every time the recursive function runs, we want to subtract one from that scoreboard, and only continue if the score is more than 0.\n\nFirst, you need to create a scoreboard in your load function. This scoreboard will store the maximum amount of times the raycast function can run:\n\nCreate the scoreboard\nscoreboard objectives add raycast dummy\n\nThen, when we want to start the raycast, we just do the following:\nTag the entity or player that starts the raycast, so we can refer back to them.\nSet the maximum distance for the raycast.\nCall the raycast function in the facing direction.\nRemove the tag at the end, so it doesn't interfere with other raycasts.\n\nTag the raycaster\ntag @s add raycaster\n\nSet the maximum distance\nscoreboard players set .raycastLimit raycast 1000\n\nBegin the raycast function\nexecute at @s anchored eyes positioned ^ ^ ^.1 run function :raycast\n\nRemove the tag from the raycaster\ntag @s remove raycaster\n\nIn the raycast function, we just want to check if the function has hit an entity, and if not, run it again until it does, hits a wall, or reaches the raycasts limit, moving slightly each time.\n\nThe next step is a bit more complex. We execute a command as every entity that is not the caster and whose hitbox intersects with the current path of the raycast (using virtual volumes). The command will return run :hit if the raycast hits an entity. The return run will stop the raycast from running further, and then will run the hit function as the entity it has hit.\n\nThe last command checks if the raycast hit a wall. If it does, the raycast will end. If it doesn't, it will then check\nif the limit is reached, again ending if it is. Should the limit not be reached yet, it will move 0.1 blocks forward and\ncall the raycast function again (recursion).\n\nRemove one from the raycast limit\nscoreboard players remove .raycastlimit raycast 1\n\nOptional: display a particle\nparticle minecraft:flame\n\nCheck if the raycast has hit an entity's hitbox\nexecute positioned -.99 -.99 -.99 as @e[dx=0,tag=!raycaster] positioned .99 .99 .99 as @s[dx=0] run return run :hit\n\nIf the raycast has not hit a wall, and the limit has not been reached, move the raycast forward and run the function again\nexecute if block   ~ #minecraft:replaceable if score raycastLimit temp matches 1.. positioned ^ ^ ^0.1 run function :raycast\n`","description":"Raycasting is when we shoot a line from the player's eyes in the direction they are looking.

There are two main types of bugs:\n\nSyntax error: This is a bug in the actual written code. This is caused by the code you write being incorrectly\nwritten so that the computer literally can't read it. For example, writing executr as @a would be a syntax error\nbecause executr isn't a command.\nLogic error: This is a bug where the written code is correctly written, but the code doesn't do what you want it\nto. This is caused by a mistake in the code logic. In the simplest example, if you want to give a player 32 diamonds,\nbut you accidentally wrote 322.\n\nFinding and debugging syntax errors\n\nSyntax errors are pretty easy to spot and fix, due to Minecraft's output logs, which literally tell you if your code is\nincorrect. When you're coding datapacks, its a good idea to always have the logs open if you need to double check it.\nYou can open the logs by opening the default Minecraft launcher and clicking \"Settings\", and then enabling \"Open output\nlog when Minecraft: Java Edition starts\", then just starting the game.\n\nA guide on how to open the Minecraft launchers output logs\n\nSyntax errors will show up in red text when you /reload your datapack. But sometimes other errors can also show in\nyellow text instead.\n\nLets take this image as an example: Output log with an error. Here, the\nerror tells you exactly where the error is - in this case it's in the function \"be:give\" at line 1 after \".... give @s\".\nAnd indeed I did spell \"loot\" as \"lot\", which caused the error.\nCode with a syntax error\n\nFinding logic errors\n\nLogic errors are more difficult to find because there's nothing actually incorrect with the code you wrote, it just does\nsomething other than what you want it to do.\n\nAn easy way to find where a logic error is in the code is to make use of the say or tellraw command. These commands\nwill send any message to the chat, making it easy for you to know when and if your code actually runs **as you\nexpect it to**. You can easily put a say Function ran correctly command in your function - If the\nfunction runs, then it will send a message to the chat. It will also send the **name of the entity that ran the\nfunction** to the chat, so you can see if your function is executed by the correct entity.\n\nSimilarly, you can use the tellraw command for more advanced debugging. The tellraw command also has the capability to\nshow you the value of scoreboards and NBT values, so you can check what data your code is using. For instance, if you\nwant to check the value of a scoreboard, you could use the following command:\n\ntellraw @a {\"score\":{\"name\":\"@s\",\"objective\":\"some_scoreboard_objective\"}}\n\nBased on the output of these commands in chat, you can use this to tell where your code goes wrong. (Just make sure to\nremove them after you've found the error, otherwise it can get annoying).\n\nYou may want to keep the debug messages in the datapack, but you don't want it to be sent to every player. Fortunately\nfor us, with the tellraw command, you can specify to who the message will be sent. This means you could only send the\ndebug messages to those who have the tag debug:\n\ntellraw @a[tag=debug] {\"text\":\"Debug message sent only to people with the debug tag!\"}\n\nDebugging logic errors\n\nUnfortunately, debugging logic errors in your code isn't as easy as fixing one spelling mistake. But yet there are still\ntechniques that we can use.\n\nOne way to solve logic errors is to recreate the error in a separate project. When you remove all the other context of\nthe pack, you can focus just on the bit which doesn't work. You can just copy out the code you want to fix into a\nseparate datapack, then fix it there. Once you've identified and fixed the problem, you'll know how to fix it in the\nreal project.\n\nSummary\n\nThe first main method for debugging datapacks is using Minecraft's output logs, we've already learnt how to use those in\nthe first part of this guide. The second method is using the in-game commands, like /say and /tellraw to print\ninformation in real-time about how your datapack works. But those are not the only ones, you can use the\n/scoreboard objectives setdisplay  command to show the values of a scoreboard on your screen in real-time,\nor you can use /data get ..., which will print the value of any NBT data in chat.\n\nA scoreboard on screen\n\nYou might also find that some other methods that suit you the best, for example you might find the\nData Reload mod useful for displaying errors in chat, or a completely different\nmethod, that is up to you.","description":"Sometimes your datapack won't work, and you will have to figure out what exactly doesn't work in them.

They allow you to modify and enhance the game by adding new features and mechanics by using Minecraft commands, advancements, worldgen, and more! This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first Minecraft datapack from scratch in the latest version.\n\n\nIf you don't know what datapacks are, then take this explanation. Datapacks are essentially add-ons to Minecraft\nwhich can change the game, whether by adding a simple game mechanic, or creating completely new experiences! The best\npart is that they're really easy to create, even if you have little coding knowledge\n\n\nThis guide will help you to create your first datapack, whether you've never tried coding before or if you've got loads\nof experience. The process of coding a datapack is a bit different to other typical programs. By the end of this\ntutorial, you'll have made a simple datapack which makes arrows explode when they land!\n\nPrerequisites\nMinecraft Datapacks basically just consist of text files inside folders. For this reason, you can technically make a datapack with just the default text editor and a file explorer. However, if you are able to, we highly suggest downloading a code editor such as Visual Studio Code. \n\nWith VS Code, you will be able to view errors in your datapack, autocomplete commands, and highlight syntax with different colours so that making datapacks isn't as painful as using Notepad.\n\nDownload Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download\nGet the VS Code extensions for datapack development: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=amandin.dpc-pack\n\n:::info\nIf you prefer not to download programs, then you can use a web version of Visual Studio Code which essentially has all the same features, except it can be slower or more difficult to work with. https://vscode.dev/\n:::\n\nSetting up an empty datapack\n\nThe first step when creating a datapack is to make a new world to test it in. Go ahead and do that now - make sure\nthat your world has cheats enabled and it is set to creative mode. Once you've created the world, the next step\nis to find and open your world folder:\n\nSave and quit your world\nGo to your world in the Singleplayer menu and hit \"Edit\"\nPress \"Open World Folder\"\n\nThe folder that opens contains all the data in your Minecraft world. You should see that there's lots of other subfolders in\nthis folder. Find the one which is called datapacks, and open it. This folder is where the world's datapacks are stored. \nCreate a folder - this will be the root folder of your datapack project. The name doesn't matter. \nI'm just going to call it Example Datapack. Open this new folder. Inside this folder is where all the data starts from.\n\n:::tip\nIf you are using Visual Studio Code, at this point you should open it, find Open Folder, and open the newly created folder. Navigating through your datapack will be so much easier!\nimage.png\n:::\n\nThe first file we want to create is the pack.mcmeta file. This file will tell Minecraft that the folder is a datapack,\nas well as holding the basic information of the pack. Create pack.mcmeta, and put this inside it:\n\n{\n\"pack\": {\n\"description\": \"DATAPACK NAME HERE\",\n\"pack_format\": 61\n}\n}\n\nIf you're interested, here's what this file means:\n\npack is an object containing the metadata of the file.\ndescription is the name of your datapack, usually along with a short description of what your pack does.\npack_format tells Minecraft what versions this datapack works in. 61 is the latest for 1.21.4\n\nWriting your first function\n\n:::info\nWhat are functions? In short, functions are the majority of what makes up most datapacks. A function is a file\ncontaining Minecraft commands. When a function is ran, every command in the function is ran in order. Functions are\nalways ran as an entity (or as the Server) and at a position\n:::\n\nLet's get started by writing one simple function. In\ntraditional programming fashion, let's make a function to show you \"Hello World\" when it is ran.\n\nCreate a folder in your datapack called data.\nIn the data folder, create a new folder. This folder is your namespace - it will contain all the data specific\nto your datapack. Usually this needs to have a unique name (one which other people would not have picked), but\nfor this tutorial just call it example.\nIn the example folder, create a folder called function. This folder will contain all the mcfunction files.\n\nYou should now have a folder structure that looks something like this:\n\n/world/datapacks/Example Datapack/data/example/function\n\n:::warning\nIn versions earlier than 1.21, the function folder should be called functions, due to some pesky name changes\nMojang introduced in a recent update.\n:::\n\nOnce you're sure that's correct, you can start writing the actual function.\n\nIn the function folder, create an empty file called hello_world.mcfunction. Open this file with any text editor (we\nrecommend Visual Studio Code)\n\nInside hello_world.mcfunction, put the following:\n\nShow the player Hello World on their screen\ntitle @s title \"Hello World!\"\n\nGive the player a diamond\ngive @s diamond\n\nIt's that simple! Once you save that file, rejoin your world and then run /reload, you should be able to use\nthe following command to run the function:\n\n/function example:hello_world\n\nWhat's next?\n\nNow you know how to create a basic function and run it, we'll next start to think about how to create our project. For\nmore advanced projects, this can sometimes be the most difficult part. Luckily for us, what we want to create won't be\ntoo difficult.\n\nLet's break down the idea into smaller steps. Remember, we want to create a datapack which makes arrows explode.\n\nDetect when an arrow lands on the ground. We can do this by running a command on a loop which will select any\narrow on the ground and then run a function.\nCreate an explosion. This is as simple as summoning a TNT at the position of the arrow.\nRemove the arrow. If you don't do this, then it will keep on exploding forever.\n\nThe next steps of this guide will guide you through the typical process of each of those steps.\n\nRunning functions on a loop\n\nThe first step on our list is to detect arrows which land on the ground. To do this, we need to run a command on a loop.\nLuckily, Minecraft makes this pretty easy for us.\n\nFirstly, let's make the function which you want to run on a loop. In the function folder, create a new mcfunction\nfile - call this one loop.mcfunction.\n\nFor now, let's just make it say \"Hi\" every time it loops. You can do this by putting this in the new function:\n\nsay Hi\n\nTo make this function run on a loop, we need to create a JSON file which tells Minecraft \"run this command every tick\"\n(every tick = 20 times per second)\n\nIn the data folder, create the minecraft folder.\nIn the minecraft folder, create a tags folder\nIn the tags folder, create a function folder\nIn the new function folder, create a new file: tick.json\n\ntick.json is NOT a function. In tick.json, we are going to put a list of functions which we want to run\nevery tick. If you put any commands in tick.json, it will break your pack.\n\nIn tick.json, put the following:\n\n{\n\"values\": [\"example:loop\"]\n}\n\nvalues is a list of function references which will be run on a loop.\nexample:loop is a reference to the loop.mcfunction file we created earlier. example refers to the namespace (the\nfolder in data), and loop refers to the mcfunction file name.\n\nIf you save this file, go back to your world, and run /reload, you should see that the chat is being spammed with \"Hi\"\nover and over again!\n\nSelecting the arrows\n\nNow we've created a function which will run infinitely on a loop, we can move on to detecting when an arrow is in the\nground.\n\nAs far as the game is concerned, an arrow is an entity, just like a pig, cow or zombie. Minecraft gives us a special\nway to select any types of entities with target selectors. Once we've selected an\nentity, we can use the /execute command to run a command as the entity.\n\nWe can use these to select all arrows which are in the ground, and then run a command to make them explode (and then\nremove themselves).\n\nAs mentioned, to select an entity, we need to use a target selectors. I'm going to teach you a bit about target\nselectors. You should pay attention here, but if you only want the code, scroll past this section.\n\nWhat are target selectors?\n\nTarget selectors are a special bit of code we can use to find an entity in the world. They all start with an @ symbol.\nThere are 6 base target selectors:\n\n| Target Selector | Description                                                                                                                                                                |\n| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| @e            | All Entities - By itself, this selector will select every single entity which is currently loaded in the world                                                         |\n| @s            | This Entity - This selector will select the entity which is currently running the command. For example, if I run a command as @s, then it will run the commands as me. |\n| @a            | All Players - This selects all currently online players. (All players are always loaded in the world).                                                                 |\n| @r            | Random Player - This selects one random player.                                                                                                                        |\n| @p            | Nearest Player - This selects the nearest player to the position this command is ran from.                                                                             |\n| @n            | Nearest Entity - This selects the nearest entity (player or non-player) to the position this command is ran from.                                                      |\n\nOn it's own, a base target selector (like in the table) does not do much. We can narrow down the selection even more by\nusing criteria. Criteria are put in square brackets after the base selector.\n\nFor example, we can use @e with a type criteria to select all entities of a certain type - for example,\n@e[type=minecraft:cow] would select all cow entities.\n\nI'm not going to explain every single criteria you can use - you can view a list\nhere. These are the basic ones which you might see quite often:\n\n| Criteria                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [type=minecraft:arrow] | Entity Type - This criteria will narrow down the selection to only include entities of a certain type. For good pack optimisation, you should use this often.                                                                                                |\n| [distance=..5]         | Distance to entity - This criteria will only include entities based on their distance to their distance to the current position. .. can be used to represent a greater/less than symbol - for example, ..5 means less than 5 blocks away.                |\n| [limit=2]              | Limit selection - Using the limit criteria, you can make specify a max amount of entities to be selected. This is often used in conjunction with the sort criteria. For example, @e[sort=nearest,limit=1] would select the nearest entity of any type. |\n| [nbt={key:value}]      | Entity Data - This criteria will select entities if their NBT (entity data) matches a pattern.                                                                                                                                                               |\n\nHow are we going to use them?\n\nWe can use these selectors to only select arrows which are in the ground. We can select all arrows with\n@e[type=arrow], but this will also include arrows in the air. To select arrows in the ground, we can check if they\nhave the data {inGround:1b}, so we would use @e[type=arrow,nbt={inGround:1b}]\n\nThis target selector can be used in an execute command to run a command as the entity. Try putting this in your\nloop.mcfunction:\n\nexecute as @e[type=arrow,nbt={inGround:1b}] at @s run say I'm an arrow, I'm in the ground!\n\nReload your datapack and fire an arrow at at a block. You should see that your chat is spammed with messages, meaning\nthat we successfully selected arrows in the ground, and executed a command as them!\n\nMake it go boom\n\nNow we can move onto the fun part! We have a simple command which will run another command as any arrow in the ground.\nWe only need to do two things with this command:\n\nSpawn an explosion at the position of the arrow\nKill the arrow so that it only explodes once\n\nTo create an explosion in Minecraft, we can simply summon a TNT entity. When a TNT entity is summoned, it will explode\ninstantly.\n\nexecute as @e[type=arrow,nbt={inGround:1b}] at @s run summon tnt\n\nThen, we just need to copy this command and make it kill the arrow after the explosion has happened. This is as simple\nas it sounds - we can use /kill to remove the arrow. Your finished loop.mcfunction should look like this:\n\nexecute as @e[type=arrow,nbt={inGround:1b}] at @s run summon tnt\nkill @e[type=arrow,nbt={inGround:1b}]\n\n:::info\nIn reality, this method isn't the best one to use. Instead of having two commands for this, you can just execute\na function as the arrow which will summon the TNT at @s's position, and then kill @s. By only using the @e selector once\nand then referring to @s, you remove extra stress from the computer. For now, it doesn't matter - this guide is designed\nto give you a better idea of the logic rather than the little details.\n:::\n\nYou're done! Once you /reload your pack, you should be free to play around with a simple exploding arrows datapack\nwhich you made with the help of this tutorial.

Fortunately, we do not need to create this texture file as it is generated automatically by the game.

This is a black-and-white mask which is applied on-top of the diamond pickaxe when it has a trim applied. Please note that the file has to use the same colors as Vanillas textures/trims/color_palettes/trim_palette (this file can be seen in the Smithing Trim Pattern chapter.)\r\nThis image has to be located in assets/minecraft/textures/trims/items/ with the name pickaxe_trim.png The texture I used can be found below:\n\nOnce you save the above files, you need to reload the resource pack with the keybind F3 + T\r\nin-game.

This guide will not go over how to give your custom items a texture or model.\n\nSince 1.21, it has been easy to create custom items in Minecraft. 1.21 introduced item components, which are like tags you can put on items to change their appearance or functionality. This is the basis for how custom items work - we take an item which already exists, then add or remove item components from that item to give it the desired feel and functionality.\n\nIn this guide we will create a custom edible item which can mine sand instantly and makes the player glow who eats it.\n\nHow do custom items work?\nCustom items are items with a unique set of item components to change their appearance and functionality. As of 1.21, we cannot create fully custom items - instead, we need to take an item which exists, and add, remove, or edit their item components to customise it. \n\nItem components cannot cover every desired functionality. An example of this is doing something when the item is right clicked. We still have to use workarounds for this, such as giving the item a food component to make it edible, then detecting when a player starts eating it. You can read more about this in our right click detection guide.\n\nCreating our custom item\nWe are going to create a custom item with the following properties:\nIt can mine sand very quickly\nIt is edible, and players who eat it will start glowing\nIt will be called Sandy McDesertface\n\nWe will use item components to give the item those properties. Item components are put after the item in our item's give command. For example:\n/give @s flint[minecraft:item_name=\"Sharp Rock\"]\nThese are all the item components which we are going to use.\n\n| Property | Component needed | Our component |\n| - | - | - |\n| Mines sand very quickly | minecraft:tool is used to make items mine different blocks quickly | [tool={default_mining_speed:1.5,damage_per_block:0,rules:[{blocks:\"minecraft:sand\",speed:100}]}] |\n| Is edible, makes the player glow | minecraft:food makes items edible. We can also use it to specify an effect for the player to recieve. | [food={nutrition:3,saturation:1,can_always_eat:true,effects:[{id:\"minecraft:glowing\",duration:100}]}] |\n| Is called Sandy McDesertface | minecraft:item_name overrides our item name. | [item_name=\"Sandy McDesertface\"] |\n\nCombining all of these together, we can create a give command for our custom item:\n/give @s minecraft:stick[tool={default_mining_speed:1.5,damage_per_block:0,rules:[{blocks:\"minecraft:sand\",speed:100}]},food={nutrition:3,saturation:1,can_always_eat:true,effects:[{id:\"minecraft:glowing\",duration:100}]},item_name=\"Sandy McDesertface\"]\n\nminecraft:stick can be any item you want. All custom items need to be based on an existing item. We do not yet have the functionality to create our own item IDs. However, we can make use of the custom_model_data (or custom_model in recent snapshots) component to change the model or texture of the item.\n","description":"Learn how to make custom items with Minecraft Java datapacks","url":"/guide/adding-new-features/custom-items/intro/","tags":["beginner","guide","custom_items","item_components"]},{"title":"Recipes for your Custom Items","content":"Creating Recipes for your Custom Items\n\nThere are two ways to add recipes to your custom items, they differentiate based on what Minecraft version you are\ndeveloping for. The first one is for the Minecraft version 1.20.5+ (Datapack format 34+), here items can be directly\nspecified in the output with item components. The second method is for all version\nbefore 1.20.5.\n\nAfter 1.20.5\n\nThis is the easier method of the two, only requiring you to put the item id and components into the recipe output.\n\n\nNote that there is currently no way to specify item components in the recipe's input items, only in the result.\nMeaning your custom item can't (easily) be crafted out of different custom items.\n\n\nThe instructions here will be very simple, requiring you to only create one file, that being the actual crafting recipe\nfile. This file can be named whatever, but has to end in the .json file format.\n\nHere is an example of a recipe with the output of a custom item:\n\n{\n\"type\": \"minecraft:crafting_shaped\",\n\"pattern\": [\n\"ttt\",\n\" s \",\n\" s \"\n],\n\"key\": {\n\"t\": {\n\"item\": \"minecraft:turtle_scute\"\n},\n\"s\": {\n\"item\": \"minecraft:stick\"\n}\n},\n\"result\": {\n\"id\": \"minecraft:iron_pickaxe\",\n\"count\": 1,\n\"components\": {\n\"minecraft:tool\": {\n\"rules\": [\n{\n\"blocks\": \"minecraft:turtle_egg\",\n\"speed\": 6,\n\"correct_for_drops\": true\n}\n],\n\"default_mining_speed\": 3,\n\"damage_per_block\": 1\n},\n\"minecraft:item_name\": \"{\\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"sCUTE-axe\\\\\\\"}\"\n}\n}\n}\n\nIn the example, you can see that the result has a \"components\" field, where you can list the components that your\ncustom item should have. I can also recommend a useful site for generating recipes with specified components:\nhttps://misode.github.io/recipe/\n\nBefore 1.20.5\n\n**This part of the guide assumes that you already knowledge some basic commands and how crafting recipes and\nadvancements work.**\n\nTo create a crafting recipe for one of your custom items, you need just a little bit more than for a normal recipe.

This method also triggers once per tick, not just once per right click.\n\nClicking an Interaction Entity\nThis method detects when the player right clicks on an interaction entity.

This method works due to the used:carrot_on_a_stick\nstatistic detecting right clicks on any carrot_on_a_stick item.\n\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we will use a carrot on a stick, shortened to COAS. This method also works with\nwarped fungus on a stick (WFOAS) items.\n\n\nCOAS and WFOAS items have a unique property that means that right clicking the item counts as \"using\" an item, and will\ntherefore increase the used:carrot_on_a_stick statistic. We can track changes to this statistic using a scoreboard.\nWhen it goes up, we know that the player has right clicked a COAS, and we can run a command when that happens.\n\nMethod\n\nTo get started, we need to create a scoreboard with the criteria item.used:minecraft.carrot_on_a_stick, so that we can\nlater detect when a player uses the COAS (by right clicking on it).\n\nIf you don't already have it, you'll need to create a load function with a command that creates a new scoreboard\nobjective. You can name the objective whatever you want. We recommend naming it something like .rc_coas. In\nyour load function, put a scoreboard command such as this:\n\nscoreboard objectives add.rc_coas minecraft.used:minecraft.carrot_on_a_stick\n\nThis scoreboard will go up by 1 every time a player right clicks a COAS - when this happens we can execute our\nfunction. Note that this command must run every tick, otherwise it won't be able to detect right clicking. Put this in\nyour tick/loop function:\n\nThis will run the \"rc_run\" function as the player who uses the COAS.\nexecute as @a[scores={.rc_coas=1..}] run function :rc_run\nscoreboard players reset @a[scores={.rc_coas=1..}].rc_coas\n\nIn the rc_run.mcfunction file, you can do whatever you like as a result of right clicking the COAS. As an\nexample, putting this in rc_run.mcfunction will make the player say Used COAS when they right click a COAS\nitem.\n\nsay Used COAS\n\nDetecting specific items\nThe above method will detect when any carrot on a stick item is right clicked, which by itself isn't useful. Instead, we want to detect when a specific carrot on a stick item is clicked.\n\nWe can give our carrot on a stick item a special custom_data component which is unique to our custom item. The custom_data component can support any NBT data, but the simplest value would be {item:\"my_custom_item\"}:\nGive the player the custom item\ngive @s carrot_on_a_stick[custom_data={item:\"my_custom_item\"}]\n\nThen, we can just add an extra check to our execute command in tick.mcfunction to only run the function when the player is holding our custom item:\nReplace the previous execute command in tick.mcfunction with this:\nexecute as @a[scores={.rc_coas=1..}] if items entity @s weapon.mainhand carrot_on_a_stick[custom_data~{item:\"my_custom_item\"}] run function :rc_run\nIf you want more than one custom item, simply copy the above command, and just change \"my_custom_item\"\n`","description":"Using a carrot on a stick for right click detection is an easy way to detect right clicks with a datapack.","url":"/guide/right-click/coas/","tags":[]},{"title":"MCFunction vs Coding","content":"MCFunction vs Traditional Coding\n\nMany people will join the datapack community with experience with traditional programming languages. While this can be\nhelpful for understanding topics, there are a lot of differences between the two, many of which can seem confusing when\nyou are used to a more traditional programming language. In this guide we touch on some common questions and problems people run into when\ntrying to apply traditional coding logic to MCFunction.\n\nQ: How do you do variables in MCFunction?\n\nMCFunction isn't like most programming languages, MCFunction uses scoreboards, storages and macros (1.20.2+) as their variables.\n\nScoreboards are like a table. They store a name and a value which you can then retrieve and modify later. You can use both entity names/UUIDs and \"fake player\" \nnames (names not associated with any player), allowing for easy combination of variables and entity scores. Scoreboards can only hold 32-bit integers and other data \ntypes (such as floats, doubles or strings) can not be stored this way.\n\nStorages are a way of storing NBT data without attaching it to an entity or block. Storages are stored globally per \nworld and unlike scoreboards, don’t need to be initialized beforehand. Unlike entity and block NBT, storages have no fixed structure, and can contain whichever \narbitrary keys are added to it.\n\nMacros are like fancy string templating, when a function is supplied with macros, it will go through the function file\nand replace the macro with its value (block, entity, storage). Interestingly, this also works function-wide, meaning you could use them as mock arguments.\n\n\nMacros can be significantly slower than other methods, it is best to only use them when necessary or in non-performance-critical code.\n\n\nBelow are some examples of their usage:\n\nScoreboards\ncreates a new table called storage\n(dummy means it does not track any statistic)\nscoreboard objectives add storage dummy\n\nadds a fake player named \"$steps\" to storage (using prefix \"$\" to avoid collisions with real players, good practice)\nscoreboard players set $steps storage 41\n\nsets the value of a player to 42\nscoreboard players set Cbble_ storage 42\n\nMacros\nRun cool function with a macro\nfunction dph:cool_function with block   ~ Items\nfunction dph:cool_function with entity @e[type=minecraft:squid,limit=1,sort=nearest] CustomName\nfunction dph:cool_function {Potato:true}\n\nUsage with entity NBT:\nexecute as @p run dph:cool_function with entity @s SelectedItem\n\nthis is in the dph:cool_function function\n$say The player running this function is holding $(count) items with ID $(id)!\n\nStorages\ndata merge storage example:main {number: 1, message: \"Hello!\"}\ndata modify storage example:main other_number set from storage example:main number\ndata modify storage example:main compound.array append value 42\n\n(Get more info on storages on the wiki page)\n\nQ: How do you loop in MCFunction?\n\nLooping in most cases is done with 1 of 2 methods, depending on the use case:\n\nRecursive Function Calls: This is when a function calls itself which will loop until some end condition is met, or forever, if one is never met.\nTick Functions (#minecraft:tick): This is a special tag you can declare that will run every function declared in it every tick, it is best\npractice to only have one of these function in a datapack at a time.\n\nQ: How do you make functions/methods?\n\nEvery MCFunction file is its own function which you can run with the function command. MCFunction does not support inheritance and inherited functions, \nbut you can call any function from anywhere in your datapack.\n\nfunction [...]\n\nQ: How do I do conditionals?\n\nYou can also do some basic conditionals with selectors, but most if not all conditionals are done with the \nexecute if subcommand, which accepts a variety of different inputs and check if they match/are equal. \nYou can learn more about execute if on the execute page.\n\nQ: How do you do math/expressions?\n\nMCFunction does math in an interesting way; it uses scoreboard operations in order to do math. Using the scoreboard players operation subcommand, you can do a \nvariety of math operations.\n\n:::note\nMCFunction does not come with complex math like trigonometry, absolutes, a pre-defined Pi, or even square root! These all must be implemented either by \nhand or with a third-party library.\n:::","description":"Learn the differences between using MCFunctions and traditional coding.","url":"/guide/mcfunction-vs-coding/","tags":[]},{"title":"Choosing a Server","content":"Choosing a Server\n\nWhen you join a Minecraft server, you are playing on a computer running a special software.

It is the most\npopular of the server softwares as it provides a wide range of plugins and features.\nModded: Modded servers are based on the Fabric or Forge, which are mod-based server softwares. They are more\ncustomizable than Bukkit-based servers, but are not as popular. The use of modded servers is still very limited,\nmaking it hard to find a mod for some purposes.\nSponge-based: Sponge is a plugin-based server software that is used by many Minecraft servers. It is similar to\nBukkit-based servers, but is more customizable and has support for mods with SpongeForge.\n\nVanilla\n\nThe vanilla server is the most basic server software, and is the one that you get when you download the jar file from\nthe official website.

For example: minecraft:cow, marker, zombie. If the namespace\n(minecraft:) is omitted, it will default to the minecraft namespace.\n[position] (optional): the coordinates at which the entity should be spawned.\n(Defaults to the current position).\n[nbt data] (optional): a compound containing the NBT (in SNBT format) which the entity should be\nspawned with. For example: {NoAI:1b}.\n\nExamples\n\nsummon minecraft:cow - Summons a cow at the current position.\nsummon minecraft:ender_dragon  50 ~ - Summons an ender dragon 50 blocks above the current position\nsummon minecraft:wither 29 372 121 - Summons a wither at the coordinates x=29, y=372, z=121\nsummon minecraft:zombie   ~ {NoAI:1b} - Summons a zombie at the current position with the NoAI NBT, meaning it\nwill not move around or attack players.\n\nAlternatives\n\nThe execute summon  command can also be used to summon an entity. Using this\nexecute subcommand will summon an entity at the current position, and then run the specified\ncommand as the newly summoned entity.\n\nHowever, execute summon cannot provide any NBT to give the entity upon being spawned.

If storing result, this numeric value is taken from the output of the final\nsubcommand (Either a run subcommand or a condition). If storing success, the value is either 1 if the final\nsubcommand succeeds (condition passes or command successfully performs its function), or 0 otherwise.\n\ntarget can be one of the following:\n\nblock : Stores the value in the specified path of the given block in the format\nspecified by type (Any numeric NBT type), and multiplied by scale.

There are 5 possible actions, as below.  \nsource determines the source of the data being used to modify the target. See source below.\n\nappend\nAppends an NBT value to a list or a typed array, making the value the last element.  \nIf the specified path does not exist in the data source, it is created and initialized as a list containing the value just appended.  \nThis is equivalent to data modify ... insert 0 ....\n\ninsert \nInserts an NBT value into a list or array at a specific index, shifting all proceeding elements to the right. Negative indices may be used to indicate inserting values from the end.  \nIf the index specified would cause the inserted item to be further than one after the first or last element of the list, the command fails.  \nInserting creates list if it doesn't exist in the same way as append.\n\nmerge\nMerges source into target at path. This is similar to data merge, but allows modifying a sub-path of a data source, and allows merging from more than just hardcoded NBT values.\n\nprepend\nPrepends an NBT value to a list or a typed array, making the value the first element.  \nLists are created in the same wat as append.  \nThis is equivalent to data modify ... insert -1 ....\n\nset\nSets the value of target at path, discarding any previously present value. This will create keys in a compound if not present, but cannot be used to add elements to an array or list, only modify existing ones.  \nset can create a chain of nested compounds if they don't already exist.  \nFor example, if the storage example:main does not yet exist, after the following command:\ndata modify storage example:main a.b.c.d set value 10\nThe example:main storage looks like this: {a: {b: {c: {d: 10}}}}.\n\nsource\nsource determines the value modifying target. It can be one of:\n\nvalue  - Gets the value from an SNBT literal.\nfrom [path] - Gets the data from the specified data source and path.\nstring [path] [start] [end] - Gets the data from the specified data source and ensures that it's a string. If start or end is specified, truncates the string using those values. start is inclusive, while end is exclusive. Both numbers are allowed to be negative, counting from the end of the string. For example, the indices 1 -1 remove one character from each end of the string, while 0 1 takes the first character.\n\nremove \nRemoves the NBT data from source at path. source is a data source and path is an NBT path.  \nThis deletes compound keys, and removes array and list elements, shifting proceeding elements left. It cannot, however, be used to delete an entire storage using the special {} path; only single keys of the root storage.\n\n:::tip\nIf you would like to be able to remove an entire storage in one go, put all your NBT data in a sub-path of it, for example:\ndata modify storage example:main temp.a set value 1\ndata modify storage example:main temp.b set value 2\nRemoves both keys\ndata remove storage example:main temp\n:::\n\nData source\nThe place to get data from or store data to. One of:\nentity  - The NBT of an entity.\nblock  - The NBT of a block entity.\nstorage  - The NBT from a data storage.\n\nData merging\nData merging is a process of merging two data values into one another.  \nThere are two values: The left side and the right side. The left side is the base of the operation, with the right being merged into the left. \n\nIf both sides of the operation are compounds, each key of the right compound is merged into the matching key of the left compound. If the key does not exist in the left compound, it is created and set to the value of the right.\n\nIf both sides are not a compound, the left is simply set to the right.","description":"The data command is used to modify and fetch NBT data of blocks, entities and storages.","url":"/wiki/command/data/","tags":[]},{"title":"NBT","content":"NBT\nNBT (Named Binary Tags) is a structured (key/value) data format used by Minecraft to store data about entities, items, blocks, structures, player data, worldgen, and more. You can use it to store custom data in items and NBT storages.\n\nSNBT Format\nSNBT (Stringified Named Binary Tags) format is a JSON-like tree structure used in datapack development to manipulate the\nNBT data of an entity. SNBT is a human-readable version of NBT (Named Binary Tags), which is a format used by Minecraft\nto store data. NBT is used to store data about entities, items, blocks, structures, game saves, and more.\n\nSNBT consists of key/value pairs, which are represented as key:value. These are contained with compounds,\nmarked with curly brackets ({}). Compounds can contain multiple key/value pairs, which are separated with commas, like\nso: key:value,key:value,key:value\n\nAn example SNBT structure looks like:\n{name:\"Silabear\",age:102,friends:[\"Flynecraft\",\"Aandeel\",\"Cobblestone\"],socials:{discord:\"silabear\"}}\n\nNBT paths\nNBT paths are used to reference a specific location within an NBT structure. They are used in commands like /data get and /data modify to access or modify NBT data. \n\nNBT paths are made up of a series of keys, separated by dots (.). Square brackets ([]) can be used to access items in an array, either by index array[0] or by object value (array[{age:102}])\n\nImagine the following NBT structure:\n\n{\nroot: {\nversion: 1,\ntitle: \"Targets\",\npeople: [\n{name: \"Silabear\", age: 102},\n{name: \"Aandeel\", age: 100}\n]\n}\n}\n\nThe following are examples of NBT paths:\nroot.version: would give the value 1.\nroot.title: would give the value \"Targets\".\nroot.people[0]: would give the value {name: \"Silabear\", age: 102}.\nroot.people[0].name: would give the value \"Silabear\".\nroot.people[{name:\"Aandeel\"}]: would give the value {name: \"Aandeel\", age: 100}.\nroot.people[{name:\"Aandeel\"}].age: would give the value 100.\n\nNBT storages\nStorages allow you to store NBT data in a world without binding it to a physical object (item, entity, block), but rather storing it under a namespaced ID (e.g example:main). Storages are stored globally per world, and can only be accessed with /data. Storages don't need to be initialized beforehand, unlike scoreboards.\n\nUnlike entity and block NBT, storages have no fixed structure, and can contain whichever arbitrary keys are added to it.\n\nStorage example\nStorages are defined when a /data command modifies them. Unlike scoreboards, storages do not need to be \"created\" -\nthe only code needed to initialize a storage is a /data modify or /data merge command to that storage, for example:\n\ndata merge storage example:main {number: 1, message: \"Hello!\"}\ndata modify storage example:main other_number set from storage example:main number\ndata modify storage example:main compound.array append value 42\n\nThe example:main storage would now contain the following data:\n\n{\nnumber: 1,\nmessage: \"Hello!\",\nother_number: 1,\ncompound: {\narray: [42]\n}\n}\n\nData Types\nThere are a few data types you can use to represent different types of data, including whole numbers, decimal numbers,\nstring, text, booleans, and more.\n\nStrings\n\nStrings can store any text value, or more technically, any sequence of unicode characters.\n\nFormat: Strings are stored within either double or single quotes. For strings containing standard characters\n(A-Z, a-z, 0-9, -,_,+,.), the quotes are optional, but recommended. \"\" or ' ' or  \n\nExample: name:\"Silabear\", name:'Cobblestone', name:Aandeel\n\nWhole Numbers\n\nShort, Int, and Long data types all represent integers (whole numbers).\n\nByte is an unsigned 8 bit integers, it can be any value from 0 to 255\nShort is a signed 16 bit integer, it can be any value from -32,768 to 32,767\nInt is a signed 32 bit integer, it can be any value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647\nLong is a signed 64 bit integer, it can be any value from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to\n9,223,372,036,854,775,807\n\nFormat: By default, numbers are stored as integers. To store a number in the other formats, you need to use the appropriate suffix.\nFor shorts, ints, and longs, the prefix is s, i, and l respectively.\n\nExample: count:1234s, bigNumber:1200000, reallyBigNumber:12123023687234L, byte:112b\n\nDecimal Numbers\n\nFloat and Double data types both represent decimal numbers.\n\nFloat is a signed 32 bit floating point number, it can be any value from -3.4028235E38 to 3.4028235E38. It is precise to 7 decimal places.\nDouble is a signed 64 bit floating point number, it can be any value from -1.7976931348623157E308 to\n1.7976931348623157E308. It is precise to 15 decimal places.\n\nFormat: By default, decimal numbers are stored as doubles. To store a number in the other formats, you need to use the\nappropriate suffix. For floats, the suffix is f. For doubles, the suffix is d.\n\nExample: pi:3.1415926535d, e:2.718281828459045d, phi:1.6180f\n\nBytes or Booleans\n\nIn older versions of Minecraft, booleans were stored as bytes with 0b representing \nfalse and 1b representing true. In newer versions, booleans were introduced.\nEssentially, booleans represent the old 0b and 1b with a more descriptive name.\nIt's recommended to use booleans instead of bytes whenever possible, as they are more readable.\n\nArrays\n\nArrays are used to store multiple values of the same type. There are currently 3 types of arrays:\n\nByte Array: Used to store multiple bytes\nInt Array: Used to store multiple integers\nLong Array: Used to store multiple longs\n\nFormat: Arrays are defined using square brackets ([]), followed by the type of the array, a semicolon, and then your data. \nThe data still has to have prefixes if it needs it.\n\nExample: [B;1b,2B,true,false], [I;1,2,3,4,5], [L;1l,2l,3l,4l,5l]\n\nValidator\n\nBelow is a validator for SNBT. It will validate the input and show you if it is valid or not.","description":"NBT is Minecraft's way of storing internal data, such as item data, entity data, and block data. In datapacks, we can use it to store data in custom data storages.","url":"/wiki/nbt-scoreboards/nbt/","tags":[]},{"title":"Scoreboards","content":"Scoreboards\nScoreboards are a key/value system for storing numbers bound to a player in Minecraft. On a scoreboard objective, each player can have a score, which is an integer value. This player does not need to exist - fake players can be used to store a number without attaching it to a player but rather an arbitrary name.\n\nYou can modify objectives with the /scoreboard or /execute store commands. Some objectives can automatically change based on player statistics.\n\nScoreboard objectives can also be optionally displayed on the sidebar, under a player's name, and/or in the tab list - although only one objective can be shown in each slot at a time.\n\nTypes of scoreboard objectives\nThere are three main types of scoreboard objectives in Minecraft.\n\nDummy objectives \nThese are objectives which can only be modified with commands, like a \"blank\" scoreboard which you can modify however you want. They are useful for storing arbitrary numbers, or tracking custom values within your datapack. \n\nYou can create this scoreboard with the command: /scoreboard objectives add objective_name dummy. For a better example, take a look at the following function:\n\nscoreboard objectives add intelligence dummy\nscoreboard players set @a intelligence 100\nexecute store result score Silabear intelligence run data get entity Silabear Health\n\nThis would create the following scoreboard:\n\n| Player | intelligence |\n| - | ------------ |\n| Player1 | 100 |\n| Player2 | 100 |\n| Silabear | 20 |\n\nYou can also put fake players on a dummy objective. These work just like normal players on an objective, except they don't exist. You can specify a fake player by using a special character such as a #, $, ., etc. before the name. For example:\nscoreboard players set intelligence #max 150\n\nCriteria-based objectives\nThese are read-only objectives which are automatically updated based on player statistics. They are usually used to track player events or progress. For example, the criteria minecraft.custom:minecraft.sneak_time will store the amount of ticks a player has been sneaking on the objective.\n\nscoreboard objectives add sneaking_duration minecraft.custom:minecraft.sneak_time\n\nAfter sneaking for one second, the objective will look like this:\n\n| Player | sneaking_duration |\n| - | ------------ |\n| Player1 | 20 |\n\nTrigger objectives: \nThese are objectives which allow the player to manually set their score using the /trigger command. This is especially useful for creating chat UIs, as it is the closest thing we have to creating \"custom commands\" with datapacks. Any player can run /trigger, regardless of their operator status.\n\nA player may only run /trigger if that trigger objective has been enabled for that user. Once a user has used /trigger on an objective, they cannot use it again until it is re-enabled.\n\nscoreboard objectives add option trigger\nscoreboard players enable @a option\n\nPlayers will now be able to use the /trigger command to modify their score on the option objective.\n\n/trigger option will set the player's score to 1.\n/trigger option set 5 will set the player's score to 5.\n/trigger option add 3 will add 3 to the player's score.\n\n\nThere is also a way to disable a scoreboard objective for players, so that they cannot trigger it until it is re-enabled:\nscoreboard players reset @a option\n","description":"Scoreboards are a way of storing numerical data attributed to a player or entity in a Minecraft Datapack.","url":"/wiki/nbt-scoreboards/scoreboards/","tags":[]},{"title":"Recipes","content":"Recipes\n\nRecipes are files which define crafting recipes in-game.

If true, the tag will overwrite other tags with the same path. If false, it will merge with them.\nvalues: An array containing everything to group under this tag. Each element can either be\nan id (e.g. \"minecraft:apple\")\nan object with an id field and a required field (e.g. {\"required\": false, \"id\":\"minecraft:stick\"}). If required is false, the tag will still skip nonexistent ids.\n\n\nTags can also reference other tags. For example, if a tag file contains #minecraft:logs, it will also contain the entire contents of the minecraft:logs tag. A tag is represented by an ID beginning with a #. For more information, refer to the resource locations page.\n\n\nExample\nHere is an example item tag file:\n\n{\n\"replace\": true,\n\"values\": [\n\"#minecraft:logs\", \n\"#minecraft:planks\", \n\"minecraft:chest\", \n\"minecraft:stick\"\n]\n}","description":"Registry tags, not to be confused with [entity tags](/wiki/command/tag), are essentially lists of groups such as blocks, items, entity types, etc. They use JSON format and are located in the `data/<namespace>/tags/<category>` folder.","url":"/wiki/files/tags/","tags":[]},{"title":"Predicates","content":"Predicates\nPredicates are a type of file which can be called to check if a certain condition is true. For instance, you can create a predicate to check if a player is walking, if an entity is above a specific Y level, or if a player is holding an item. They are extremely versatile and, in many cases, more optimised than execute if commands.\n\n\nAlthough this page covers predicate files, predicates are also used within in advancements and loot table files. The structure of these predicates is the same as described here, although some fields may not be used in certain contexts.\n \n\nExamples\nThis predicate will use the entity_properties condition check if the player is holding a beef item while being inside a desert village:\n{\n\"condition\": \"minecraft:entity_properties\",\n\"entity\": \"this\",\n\"predicate\": {\n\"location\": {\n\"structures\": \"minecraft:village_desert\"\n},\n\"equipment\": {\n\"mainhand\": {\n\"items\": \"minecraft:beef\"\n}\n}\n}\n}\n\nWe can use @a[predicate=namespace:my_predicate] to select all players who match the predicate. For example:\nexecute as @a[predicate=namespace:my_predicate] run say I am holding beef in a desert village :D\n\nJSON Format\nEach predicate is represented as a JSON object. Predicate files can either contain one predicate object, or a list of predicate objects. Each predicate object needs a condition field, which specifies the type of condition to check. The rest of the fields depend on the condition type.\n\nFor more information about the JSON format in general, see the JSON page.\n\nCertain objects are commonly reused within different predicate (and advancement) conditions. Below are some of them, along with their JSON structure:\n\nNumber providers\nA number provider is used in a predicate to provide a number. This could be a constant, score value, random value, etc. \n\nThis can simply be a number (e.g 4 or 5.87). This can also be an object with a min and max field to represent a random number (e.g {\"min\":1, \"max\":10}). For more advanced providers, they are represented as objects - the contents of the object will vary based on which type field you use. The available type fields, along with the fields required for them, are as follows:\n\n\"binomial\": Provides a random number based on binomial distribution. Requires the following fields:\nn: The number of trials used for the binomial distribution. This should be an int or number provider\np: The chance of success for each trial. This should be an int or number provider\n\n\"constant\": Provides the specified number. Requires the following field:\nvalue: The value to provide. This should be an int or a float\n\n\"score\": Provides the score of the entity as a number. Requires the following fields:\ntarget: An object to specify the score holder. Contains a type field - if set to fixed, then a name field should be used to specify which player's (by username) or entity's (by UUID) score to use. If set to context, then a target field should be used with one of the following: this, killer, direct_killer, killer_player\nscore: The objective name to get the entity's score from.\nscale: If present, then the score is multiplied by scale.\n\n\"storage\": Provides the value from a specific path in an NBT storage. Requires the following fields:\nstorage: The storage ID to get the score from.\npath: The NBT path to the specified field in the storage.\n\n\"uniform\": Provides a random number between two values. Requires the following fields:\nmin: The minimum number to return. This should be a number or number provider.\nmax: The maximum number to return. This should be a number or number provider.\n\nItem matcher\nAn item matcher is used to match an item with advanced filters for components and count. \n\nAn item matcher is an object which can consist of the following fields:\nitems: The item type(s) to match. This can either be string (with an item ID or item tag ID), or an array of item IDs.\ncount: The count of the item stack. This can either be an integer or an object with a min and max key to match a range of counts.\ncomponents: An object containing the item components to match. The key is the component name, and the value is the expected value in the component. This will only match if the component is exactly the same as the value - if any other data is in the component, it will be false.\npredicate: Like components, but will match if the component at least contains the specified data, rather than only matching if it is exactly the same.\n\nConditions\nThese are all the possible conditions that can be used in a predicate.\n\nblock_state_property\nblock_state_property checks if the block state(s) of the block is/are equal to a specified value(s). This predicate type is not usable with execute if predicate, instead, this predicate is used in a loot table to check a block.\n\nFields:\nblock: The block ID to match (e.g minecraft:andesite_wall)\nproperties: A map of block state properties to match. The key is the property name, and the value is the property value. For instance, {\"waterlogged\":\"true\", \"south\":\"tall\"}.\n\ndamage_source_properties\ndamage_source_properties checks the source of damage. This is often used in advancements and loot tables.\n\nFields: \npredicate: An object containing the following keys:\ntags: A list of damage_type tags to match. Checks if the type of damage is inflicted in any of these tags (can be toggled with the expected field). For instance, [{\"id\":\"minecraft:bypasses_shield\",\"expected\":true}].\nsource_entity: An entity_properties predicate to match the source entity (inflicter, e.g skeleton) of the damage.\ndirect_entity: An entity_properties predicate to match the direct entity (entity responsible, e.g arrow entity) for the damage.\n\nenchantment_active_check\nenchantment_active_check checks if the enchantment is active. This can only be used in enchantments.\n\nFields:\nactive: If set to true, will check that the enchantment is active. If false, will check that the enchantment is inactive.\n\nentity_properties\nentity_properties checks if the entity matches the specified properties. This is very often used in datapacks - it can be used to check players and entities with the predicate= selector argument, and execute if predicate.\n\nFields:\nentity: Who to check. Can be this (equivalent of @s), attacker (the entity that attacked), direct_entity (the entity that caused the damage), or attacking_player.\npredicate: An object containing all the entity properties to check. There are lots of these, and going into full detail would take a lot of space (use a generator like misode.github.io to create these more efficiently):\ntype: The entity type to match. For instance, minecraft:player.\ntype_specific: An object that contains properties which may only be specific to one type of entity.\nteam: The team that the entity is on.\nnbt: An NBT object to match. This should be in a string. For instance, \"{Health:20}\".\nlocation: A location_check predicate to match the entity's location.\ndistance: An object which is used to match the distance between the entity and wherever the predicate is being checked.\nflags: An object which is used to match certain true/false flags of the entity, such as if they are on fire, or if they are sneaking.\nequipment: An object which is used to match the equipment (head, chest, mainhand, etc.) of the entity. The key is the slot (e.g head), and the value is an item matcher.\nvehicle: Another entity_properties predicate to match the entity which this entity is riding.\npassenger: Another entity_properties predicate to match the entity which is riding this entity.\nstepping_on: Following the same structure as location, this matches the block the entity is standing on.\ntargeted_entity: Another entity_properties predicate to match the entity which this entity (non-player) is targeting.\neffects: An object which matches the current status effects of this entity\nslots: An object which matches the contents of the entity's inventory slots.\nmovement: An object which matches the movement of the entity.\nperiodic_tick: Returns true once every x ticks of the entity's lifetime.\nmovement_affected_by: Following the same structure as location, this matches what affects the movement of the entity.\n\nentity_scores\nentity_scores checks if the entity's score on an object matches a specified value or range. \n\nFields:\nentity: Who to check. Can be this (equivalent of @s), attacker (the entity that attacked), direct_entity (the entity that caused the damage), or attacking_player.\nscores: An object containing the scores to check. The key is the objective name, and the value is either an int (e.g 33) or an object containing a min and max number provider to match a range. For instance, {\"scoreboard1\":5, \"scoreboard2\":{\"min\":1, \"max\": 10}}.\n\nkilled_by_player\nkilled_by_player checks if the entity was killed by a player. This is used in loot tables.\n\nFields:\ninverse: If true, checks if the entity was not killed by a player. (optional)\n\nlocation_check\nlocation_check checks if the current location matches the specified properties. When used in an entity_properties -> location field, it checks the entity's location, but if used in a loot table, it checks the location of the loot source (block or entity).\n\nFields:\nposition: The coordinates in the world to check. This is an object containing the following keys:\nx: The x coordinate to match. This should be a number or a number provider.\ny: The y coordinate to match. This should be a number or a number provider.\nz: The z coordinate to match. This should be a number or a number provider.\nbiomes: A biome or list of biomes to match. Will be true if the location is within a biome. For instance, [\"minecraft:plains\", \"minecraft:forest\"].\nstructures: A structure or list of structures to match. Will be true if the location is within a structure. For instance, [\"minecraft:village\", \"minecraft:woodland_mansion\"].\ndimension: The dimension to match. Will be true if the location is in a predicate For instance, minecraft:overworld.\nlight: The light level to match. This should be a single int, or an object containing a min and max number provider to match a range.\nblock: The block to match. This should be an object containing the following:\nblocks: A block ID or list of block IDs to match. For instance, [\"minecraft:mycelium\", \"minecraft:grass_block\"].\nstate: An object containing the block state properties to match. For instance, {\"waterlogged\":\"true\", \"south\":\"tall\"}.\nnbt: An NBT string to match. Will be true if the block at the location contains all of the specified NBT (ignoring other tags). For instance, \"{Items:[{id:\\\"minecraft:stick\\\",Count:1b}]}\".\nfluid: The fluid to match. This should be an object containing the following:\nfluids: A fluid ID or list of fluid IDs to match. For instance, [\"minecraft:water\", \"minecraft:flowing_water\"].\nstate: An object containing the fluid state properties to match. For instance, {\"level\":\"2\"}.\nsmokey: Checks if the location is within 5 blocks veritically of a campfire. This should be a boolean.\ncan_see_sky: Checks if the the sky light level is the highest it could be. This should be a boolean.\n\nmatch_tool\nmatch_tool matches the item used to perform an action. Contrary to what may seem intuitive, this can not be used to check the player's mainhand item in a predicate referenced in predicate= or execute if predicate - this is only for loot tables and advancements.\n\nFields:\npredicate: An item matcher.\n\nrandom_chance\nrandom_chance will be true if a random decimal is less than the value in chance. For instance, 0.5 would be true 50% of the time, 0.25 would be true 25% of the time, etc.\n\nFields:\nchance: The chance of the predicate being true. This should be a float between 0 and 1.\n\nrandom_chance_with_enchanted_bonus\nrandom_chance_with_enchanted_bonus is similar to random_chance, but you can specify a different random chance if the tool used has a certain enchantment. This is used in loot tables and advancements.\n\nFields:\nunenchanted_chance: The chance of the predicate being true if the tool is not enchanted. This should be a float between 0 and 1.\nenchanted_chance: The chance of the predicate being true if the tool is enchanted. This should be a float between 0 and 1.\nenchantment: The enchantment ID to check for. For instance, minecraft:fortune.\n\nsurvives_explosion\nsurvives_explosion will be true if the entity survived an explosion. This is used in loot tables. This predicate type has no other fields.\n\ntable_bonus\nEssentially, table_bonus is a more advanced version of random_chance_with_enchanted_bonus, as you can specify a different chance for each enchantment level\n\nFields: \nenchantment: The enchantment ID to check for. For instance, minecraft:fortune. \nchances: An array of chances for each enchantment level. The first item in the array would be the chance for enchantment level 1, and so on.\n\ntime_check\ntime_check checks the current time.\n\nFields:\nvalue: The time to check, represented in game ticks. This should be a single int, or an object containing a min and max number provider to match a range.\nperiod: If present, value will check for GAMETIME modulo . For instance, setting period to 24000 (the amount of ticks in a day) would check for the current daytime\n\nvalue_check\nvalue_check simply matches a value from a number provider against a range or constant.\n\nFields:\nvalue: A number or a number provider to check against.\nrange: The range used to check value (will return true if value is within this range). This should be a single int, or an object containing a min and max number provider to match a range.\n\nweather_check\nweather_check matches the current weather in the world. To check for sun, you would need to set both fields to false.\n\nFields: \nraining: Checks if it is currently raining. This should be a boolean.\nthundering: Checks if it is currently thundering. This should be a boolean\n\nSpecial Conditions\nThese conditions are special as they are used in conjunction with one or more other conditions to alter the result of the predicate, often acting like logic gates.\n\nall_of or any_of\nall_of and any_of are self explanatory. all_of checks if all specified predicates are true, and any_of checks if any specified predicates are true.\n\nFields:\nterms: A list of predicates to check. This cannot be the ID of the current predicate.\n\ninverted\ninverted will invert the output of the predicate. If the predicate would return true, using this would make it return false, and vice versa.\n\nFields:\nterm: A predicate to check. This cannot be the ID of the current predicate.\n\nreference\nreference simply references another predicate file, as if you included the predicate in the current one. This is useful for reusing predicates across multiple files.\n\nFields:\nname: A predicate ID to check. This cannot be the ID of the current predicate.","description":"Predicates are a type of file which can be called to check if a certain condition is true.","url":"/wiki/files/predicates/","tags":[]},{"title":"Functions","content":"Functions\n\nFunctions are files essentially containing a list of Minecraft commands.

This changes their reference accordingly - for example,\na function located at data/ /function/sub_folder/my_func.mcfunction would be called using\nfunction :sub_folder/my_func.\n\nWhen a function is run, the commands within it are executed in order. If the return command is run, the function stops\nexecuting immediately and any commands after the return are ignored.\n\nAny line in a function which starts with a # is a comment, and the game ignores it. Any other line is interpreted\nas a command\n\nExample\n\nThis function will give every player an apple, then tell them to enjoy the apple.\n\nGive a player the apple\ngive @a minecraft:apple\n\nTell them to enjoy the apple\nsay Enjoy the apple!\n\nMacro functions\n\nMacros can dynamically change part of a function by inserting NBT into it. Any function can define a macro within it. A\nmacro is a command beginning with $. Macros can use a special syntax: $().

Each command is a simple instruction which can tell the game\nto do something. Most datapacks are made primarily of functions - functions are just lists of\ncommands ran in order.\n\nThere are too many commands for this wiki to go over each one individually. However, important commands can be found in the Command Reference section of the sidebar.\n\nCommand Context\nProgramming Minecraft command is unique. Commands are always run with context - this means commands always have a position (in a dimension), rotation, and executor entity. Functions inherit context from their caller, so if you run a function in chat, all the commands in the function will have the same context as if you ran them in chat.\n\nFunctions ran by the game, for instance tick, load, and scheduled functions, will have the follwing context:\nthe executor is the game server. If you use @s in a command, it will not refer to any entity. \nthe position of the command is the world spawn\nthe rotation of the command is 0, 0\n\nIf you run a command in chat, then:\nyou are the executor entity. If you use @s in a command, it refers to you.\nthe position and rotation of the command are where you are standing and looking. If you use   ~ in a command, it refers to where your position.\n\nThe /execute command will change the context of a command.

They are used to represent positions of\nentities, blocks, particles, sounds and more. In commands, they are represented as simply x y z, where x, y, and\nz are decimal numbers representing the coordinates on each axis.\n\nBlock coordinates are locked to the grid and are unique - there can only be one block per set of coordinates. Block\ncoordinates are whole numbers, for example you can have a block at 123 86 94 but not 123.7 86.2 94.6. Entities are\nnot locked to the grid - they can be at decimal positions (and usually are).\n\nx.0 y.0 z.0 represents the bottom left corner of a block, not the centre. The centre of a block would be represented\nby the coordinates x.5 y.5 z.5.\n\n\nEvery command and function in Minecraft is always executed at a position. This is usually the world spawn. You\ncan change this using the commands \"execute at\" or \"execute positioned\".\n\n\nExamples\n\n/setblock 123 86 94 minecraft:pink_concrete: In this setblock command, we tell the game to put a pink concrete\nblock at the coordinates 123 86 94.\n/tp @s 66.2 98 45.7: This command would teleport the current entity to the exact coordinates 66.2 98 45.7\n\nRelative Coordinates\n\nUsing the symbols ~ and ^, we can reference coordinates relative to the current coordinates (for example, you can\nget the position 7 blocks above the current position).\n\n represents the current position on any axis. For example, 12  76 would teleport me to x=12 z=76 but keep y\nas the current position. The coordinates   ~ would represent the position of the command - this is useful to do\nsomething at the current position such as placing a block or summoning an entity.\n\nThe  symbol can be followed by a number to include an offset to the current position. For example,  12  would\nrepresent the current position offset by 10 blocks on the y-axis (or in simpler terms: the position 10 blocks above\nthe current position). This can also be a negative number.\n\nSimilarly ^ represents a relative position, taking into account the current rotation too. The most common use for this\nis to get a position in front of the direction of rotation.

The target selector is @a[distance=..10],\nand tells the game to only send the message to players within 10 blocks.\n\nBase target selectors\n\nIn Java Edition, there are 6 base target selectors:\n\n| Target Selector | Description                                                                                                                                                                |\n| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| @e          | All Entities - By itself, this selector will select every single entity which is currently loaded in the world                                                         |\n| @s          | This Entity - This selector will select the entity which is currently running the command. For example, if I run a command as @s, then it will run the commands as me. |\n| @a          | All Players - This selects all currently online players. (All players are always loaded in the world).                                                                 |\n| @r          | Random Player - This selects one random player.                                                                                                                        |\n| @p          | Nearest Player - This selects the nearest player to the position this command is ran from.                                                                             |\n| @n          | Nearest Entity - This selects the nearest entity (player or non-player) to the position this command is ran from.                                                      |\n\n\n@e only selects entities in a loaded chunk. If an entity exists but is not currently being loaded, it will\nnot select that entity.\n\n\nAdditional arguments\n\nTarget selectors can (and usually are) followed by additional arguments to filter the selection even more to only find\nthe entities that you want. Target selector arguments are contained within square brackets after the base selector\n(@e[...]) and are written as [ :, =,...]\n\nExample: In our previous example (@a[distance=..10]), we use the argument distance=..10 to specify that we only\nwant to target entities which are less than 10 blocks away.\n\n:::tip\nMost target selectors can be inverted by using =! meaning it will only select entities who do not match the\nargument. (E.g. @e[type=!minecraft:creeper] will select every entity that is NOT a creeper)\n:::\n\n| Argument           | Example                                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| type             | @e[type=minecraft:pig]                                   | Filters to only include entities of a certain type or entity_type tag.

We use target selectors to find players or mobs and do things to them.","url":"/wiki/concepts/target-selectors/","tags":[]},{"title":"JSON Text","content":"JSON Text\nStyled text (bold, underline, colours, etc) is represented as JSON in Minecraft. A JSON text component is a way to format styled text in Minecraft commands, and is used in many places such as /tellraw, /title, and more.\n\nInstead of just using standard text (for example \"Hello World\"), we can use JSON text to format the text in a variety of ways, including colours, text effects, click events, hover events, language-based text, accessing NBT data, and more.\n\nFor more information about the JSON format in general, see the JSON page.\n\nFormat\nA JSON text component is formatted as either an object ({\"text\":\"Hello World\",\"color\":\"red\"}), or an array of objects ([{\"text\":\"Hello\"},{\"text\":\"World\"}]). An object could just be a normal string ([\"Hello\", \"World\"] is valid JSON text). \n\nIf the JSON text component is an array, then all the objects inherit the style from the first object. For instance, if the first object in an array is styled to be red, then all the other objects in the array will also be red unless specified otherwise. \n\nContent sources\nThe actual text of a JSON text object can be either static text or from a source such as NBT or scoreboard. Every object requires one of the following:\n\"text\":\"\": A simple string of text.\n\"score\":{\"name\":\"\",\"objective\":\"\"}: The score of a player in an objective. In some cases, name can be set to \"*\", which will access the score of the player viewing the text.\nNBT: This will display the value of an NBT tag. If \"nbt\" is used in a JSON text object, then one of \"storage\", \"entity\", or \"block\" is also required. The following properties should be used:\n\"nbt\":\"\": The path to the NBT value. This is required - it should be a string value following the NBT path format.\n\"storage\":\"\": The storage to get the NBT value from.\n\"entity\":\"\": The entity to get the NBT value from.\n\"block\":\" \": The block to get the NBT value from.\n\"interpret\":(true/false): If true, then the NBT value's text will be parsed and interpreted as a JSON text object. Defaults to false.\n\"selector\":\"\": The name of a player or entity. \n\"translate\":\"\": A translation key from language files defined in a resource pack. This will display the value of the key in the player's selected language.\nwith: This can also optionally be used to insert arguments into the translation key. This should be an array of JSON text objects.\nfallback: This can also optionally be used to specify what to display if the translation is not found. If this is not specified, the key itself will be displayed if the translation is not found. This should be a string value.\n\"keybind\":\"\": The key which a player has bound to a keybind. (For example, key.jump would show the text Space, assuming the player has not changed the keybind).\n\nExample: This JSON text object will display the value of the path ShopData.Name in the NBT storage minecraft:xyz:\n{\"nbt\":\"ShopData.Name\",\"storage\":\"minecraft:xyz\"}\n\nStyle properties\nThe following properties can be used in a JSON text object to change the style of the text:\ncolor: The colour of the text. This can be one of the 16 standard colours (e.g \"red\", \"light_purple\", etc.), or a hex colour code (e.g \"#ff0000\").\nbold: Whether the text is bold. This can be true or false.\nitalic: Whether the text is italic. This can be true or false.\nunderlined: Whether the text is underlined. This can be true or false.\nstrikethrough: Whether the text is strikethrough. This can be true or false.\nobfuscated: Whether the text is obfuscated. Obfuscated text applies a special glitch effect to the text. This can be true or false.\n\nExample: This text will be \"Hello World\", in red, bold, and strikethrough:\n{\"text\": \"Hello World\", \"color\": \"red\", \"bold\": true, \"strikethrough\": true}\n\nInteractivity properties\nThe following properties can be used in a JSON text object to add interactivity to the text:\ninsertion: Can be used to specify text to be inserted into the chat when the text is shift-clicked. This should be a string value.\nclickEvent: Can be used to specify an action to be performed when the text is clicked. This should be an object with the following properties:\naction: The action to be performed. This can be one of the following:\n\"open_url\": Opens the url in value in the player's web browser.\n\"run_command\": Runs the command in value (the player needs permission to run the commands, and this excludes commands like /say or /tell which make the player send something to chat).\n\"suggest_command\": Opens and inserts the contents of value into the player's chat box.\n\"copy_to_clipboard\": Copies value to the clipboard.\n\"change_page\": (books only) Changes the page of the book to the page specified in value.\nvalue: The value of the action. This should be a string value.\nhoverEvent: Can be used to specify what happens when a player hovers over the text. This should be an object with the following properties\naction: The action to be performed. This can be one of the following:\n\"show_text\": Shows the text in contents in a tooltip by the player's mouse.\n\"show_entity\": Shows the entity in contents in a tooltip by the player's mouse.\n\"show_item\": Shows the item in contents in a tooltip by the player's mouse.\nvalue: The value of the action. This changes based on the action:\nIf \"show_text\" is the action, this should be a JSON text object or array.\nIf \"show_entity\" is the action, this should be an object which represents the entity to be displayed in the tooltip. This needs the properties \"id\", \"type\", and \"name\". This is used for the selector component type\nIf \"show_item\" is the action, this should be an object which represents the item to be displayed in the tooltip. This needs the properties \"id\", \"count\", \"components\".\n\nExample: This text will be \"Click me\", in blue, and when clicked, it will run the command /say Hello:\n{\"text\": \"Click me\", \"clickEvent\": {\"action\": \"run_command\", \"value\": \"/say Hello\"}}\n\nOther\nextra: This property can be used to add another JSON text object after, which inherits all the styles and interactivity from the parent object.\nseparator: If the text source returns multiple values (e.g. multiple entities with the selector source, or multiple NBT values with the nbt source), this can be used to specify the separator between the values. This should be a string value.\n\nJSON text generators\nWriting JSON text manually can be tedious - there are numerous generators which can be used to quickly create JSON text objects. Here are our recommendations:\nMinecraft Tools\nMinecraftJSON.com\nMisode","description":"Styled text in Minecraft commands is done through a JSON text format.","url":"/wiki/concepts/json-text/","tags":[]},{"title":"Ranges","content":"Ranges\nA range specifies a set of values between two numbers. Ranges are used in some commands (such as execute) and selectors to specify a set of values to compare against.\n\nFor example, the distance= selector accepts a range to select entities within a certain distance from the player. The range distance=..10 selects entities within 10 blocks of the player.\n\nGreater than (x >= 10)\nTo specify a range of numbers such as \"x or greater\", we can use the min.. syntax. The following range represents \"10 or greater\". Note that this range includes 10.\n10..\n\nLess than (`x","description":"A range specifies a set of values between two numbers.","url":"/wiki/concepts/ranges/","tags":[]},{"title":"JSON","content":"JSON Format\nJSON is a data storage type used by Minecraft Datapacks for files such as predicates and tags, as well as in JSON Text. JSON is a way of storing data, usually used in .json files but is also seen in .mcmeta files too.\n\nHow JSON works\nJSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It was originally created as a way of writing objects in Javascript. These days, JSON is used in almost every programming environment, datapacks included.\n\nJSON is a way of storing information so that both a computer and a human can understand it. It stores data as key-value pairs - this means that a key (such as name) can store any value (such as Aron Aronson). The code can ask for name, and it will get the result Aron Aronson.\n\nA .json file usually is itself just a JSON object (aka a JSON dictionary). A JSON dictionary is like a real dictionary because it holds sets of key/value pairs - just like how a dictionary consists of word/definition pairs. In a JSON dictionary, the key and value are separated by a colon (\"key\":value), and each key/value pair is separated by a comma.\n\nExample JSON\n{\n\"name\":\"Aron Aronson\",\n\"age\":83,\n\"alive\":true,\n\"family_members\":[\n\"James Aronson\",\n\"Catherine Aronson\"\n],\n\"login_details\":{\n\"email\":\"aron.aronson@gmail.com\",\n\"password\":\"MyNameIsAron12345\"\n}\n}\nAn explanation of this file:\nEverything is contained within curly brackets {...}, which means that the whole file is a JSON dictionary.\nThe first key/value pair is \"name\":\"Aron Aronson\". The key here is name, and it has a string (text) value: \"Aron Aronson\"\nThe second key/value pair is \"age\":83. The key here is age, and it has a integer (whole number) value of 83. The number isn't \" signs, because if a value is in \" signs, it is considered to be text.\nThe third key/value pair is \"alive\":true. The key here is alive, and it has a boolean (true/false) value of true.\nThe fourth key/value pair is \"family_members:[...]\". The key here is family_members, and it has a list value (indicated by the square brackets []). This list has two string (text) values. The list does not contain key/value pairs, just values.\nThe final key/value pair is \"login_details\":{...}. The key here is login_details, and it has a dictionary value. The dictionary itself contains two key/value pairs.\n\nNote that the key in a key/value pair is contained within \" signs - don't confuse this with the string data type seen in the first key/value pair. The key is always on the left of the colon, and is always in \" signs. The value is always on the right of the colon, and should only use \" signs if it is a text value.\n\nTypes of values\nYou can use the following data types for JSON values:\nString (e.g \"Hi! I am text\"): A string is plain text. Everything inside the string should be contained within \" or ' signs. If you want to use one of those signs within the string without making the computer think the string has ended, put a \\ before the character (e.g \"Dave said \\\"Hello\\\".\")\nInteger (e.g 42): An integer (often called an int) is a whole number. This is also often used to store date and time values (seconds since Jan 1 1970)\nFloat (e.g 12.5): A float (short for \"floating point number\") is any decimal number. The decimal point needs to be a . symbol.\nBoolean (e.g true or false): A boolean is either true or false. In some circumstances, these are just easier ways to write 1 or 0.\nList (e.g [123, \"hello\", 456, \"goodbye\"]): A list is an ordered collection of values (not key/value pairs). List items should be contained within square brackets ([]) and separated with a comma. Confusingly, the first item in a list is \"item 0\", the second one is \"item 1\", etc.\nDictionary (e.g {\"name\":\"Aron\", \"age\":94}): A dictionary contains key/value pairs, separated by commas. The key needs to be inside \" signs, and followed by a colon.\n\nJSON Paths\nA JSON path is basically the address of a specific value within a JSON structure. Nested dictionaries (if the value of a key is a dictionary) are separated by . signs, otherwise it's pretty straightforward how they work. \n\nIf we assume that root contains the entirety of the example file (remember that the contents of the file itself is just a JSON dictionary), then the following paths can be used:\nroot.name would return \"Aron Aronson\"\nroot.alive would return true\nroot.family_members[0] would return \"James Aronson\" (the first item in the array)\nroot.login_detiails.password would return \"MyNameIsAron12345\"\n\nIn datapacks, you will not use JSON paths often, but you will use NBT paths, which are very similar.\n\n\nThe format for paths above is only the most commonly seen path format. Other languages, such as Python, use a different format, such as:\nroot\"login_details\"\n`","description":"A rough guide to the JSON format used in Minecraft Datapacks (among other places)","url":"/wiki/info/json/","tags":[]},{"title":"Breaking Changes","content":"List of breaking changes\n\nThis is list of all breaking changes to datapacks (excluding resource packs).
