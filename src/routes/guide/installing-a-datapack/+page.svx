# Introduction

So you've found a nice datapack for Minecraft, and the next step is to get it into your game. This guide will explain how to install a datapack onto a world which exists, a new world.

## Installing a datapack to an existing world

1. In your world menu, find the world which you want to install the datapack on. Click **Edit**.

4. Put the datapack zip file into the folder.

   <Info>If the zip folder contains a folder which contains "data" and "pack.mcmeta", then put that folder in the datapacks folder instead of the full zip. Putting the zip in the datapacks folder **only works** when "data" and "pack.mcmeta" are directly in the root folder of the zip.</Info>
5. Rejoin the world and run /reload.

## Installing a datapack to an new world

1. Go to the Create New World screen. Make sure that you enable cheats.

   <Info>If it doesn't show up, then it's likely that the zip file contains a folder which contains the datapack, and not the zip file just containing the datapack. You need to take the folder out of the datapack, and put it in the datapacks folder (click the "Open Packs Folder" button to open it.)</Info>
4. Click on the datapack icon to apply it to the world
