# How to add custom mob variants

By the end of this guide, you will be able to add your own naturally spawning mob variants, including custom spawn conditions.

This will only work in 1.21.5+, as data-driven mob variants were added in the snapshot 25w04a. 
:::info 
This guide requires you
to have at least a small understanding of datapacks. If you don't understand this guide, you can read the [Getting Started
guide](/guide/getting-started).

## Creating a cat variant

### Setting up the datapack

To start you will need a basic datapack, if you don't know how to make one, see the
[Getting Started](/guide/getting-started) guide.

Firstly, we are going to create the main cat variant file in the directory `data/<namespace>/cat_variant/`.
You can name the file whatever you want, but it has to be in the `.json` file format. For the purposes of this tutorial, we're
going to call it `example_cat.json`. Inside, we will put and configure these settings:

```json:example_cat.json
{
  "asset_id": "example:entity/cat/example_cat",
  "spawn_conditions": [
    {
      "priority": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

This is a run-down of the fields in that file:
- `asset_id`: The resource location of the paintings texture to use. In this example, `example:entity/cat/example_cat` directs to `assets/example/textures/entity/cat/example_cat.png`.
-  `spawn_conditions`: A list of spawn conditions, each with a priority. Right now we only have one, with a priority of 0. This means it will spawn like any other cat texture.

### Settings up the resource pack

Next we are going to add the actual texture file for the cat variant. This needs to be placed in `assets/<namespace>/textures/entity/cat/`, and match the name you specified in the `asset_id` field earlier. In this example that is `example_cat.png`.

### Testing

If you load the datapack and the resource pack, you should now be able to spawn your cat using `/summon minecraft:cat ~ ~ ~ {variant:"example:example_cat"}`

:::warning
For this to work, you will need to leave and rejoin the world, just using the `/reload` command won't do the trick here!

## Adding more spawn conditions

To add more spawn conditions, you can add more entries to the `spawn_conditions` field in the .json file you created earlier.

```json:example_cat.json
{
  "asset_id": "example:entity/cat/custom",
  "spawn_conditions": [
    {
      "condition": {
        "type": "minecraft:structure",
        "structures": "minecraft:village_snowy"
      },
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "condition": {
        "type": "minecraft:biome",
        "biomes": "snowy_taiga"
      },
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "priority": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

This cat variant will spawn with a priority level of 1 if it spawns in a snowy village or a snowy taiga. If another cat variant were to meet its spawn conditions, the game would randomly select a variant.

For more spawn conditions, see [this page](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob_variant_definitions#Spawn_condition) on the minecraft wiki.

## Other mobs with variants

You can also add variants for these mobs:
- chicken
- cow
- frog
- pig
- wolf

For example, if you wanted to add a frog variant, you would:
1. Create a variant file in `data/<namespace>/frog_variant`
2. Add something like the following to the file:

```json:example_frog.json
{
  "asset_id": "example:entity/frog/example_frog",
  "spawn_conditions": [
    {
      "priority": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Add the texture to `assets/<namespace>/textures/entity/frog/example_frog`

## Mobs with additional fields

If you want to add a chicken, cow, or pig variant, you'll also need to specify the `model` field, like this:

```json:example_cow.json
{
  "asset_id": "example:entity/cow/example_cow",
  "model": "normal",
  "spawn_conditions": [
    {
      "priority": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

The `model` field can be `normal`, `cold` or `warm` for cows, and just `normal` or `cold` for chickens and pigs.

If you want to add a wolf variant, you'll need to specify 3 textures, like this:

```json:example_wolf.json
{
  "assets": {
    "angry": "example:entity/wolf/example_wolf_angry",
    "tame": "minecraft:entity/wolf/example_wolf_tame",
    "wild": "minecraft:entity/wolf/example_wolf"
  },
  "spawn_conditions": [
    {
      "priority": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

It's worth noting that you can't add custom variants for some mobs like Horses and Rabbits. If it's not in the list mentioned earlier, then it can't be added using a datapack.
