# Resource Locations
A resource location is a way of referencing a resource in a datapack (or resourcepack), such as a function. 

## Example
This is an example of a resource location for a function:
```mcfunction
/function my_namespace:some_folder/my_function
```
This resource location would try and access the function `/data/my_namespace/function/some_folder/my_function.mcfunction`. Notice how we don't need to specify the `function` folder in the resource location, as it is implied by the `/function` command.

## Resource locations for tags
To reference a tag (ie the function tag `#minecraft:load`), you can use the `#` symbol before the tag name. For example:
```mcfunction
/function #minecraft:load
```
This resource location would try and access the tag `/data/minecraft/tags/function/load.json`. In this case, all functions in the tag would be ran.

## Default namespace
If the namespace (`my_namespace`, before the colon) is left out, it will default to the `minecraft` namespace.

```mcfunction
/function some_folder/my_function
```
This resource location would try and access `/data/minecraft/function/some_folder/my_function.mcfunction`.

## Allowed characters
A file name (and resource location) can only contain lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), underscores (`_`), dashes (`-`) and periods (`.`). In a resource location, `/` can be used to separate folders.
