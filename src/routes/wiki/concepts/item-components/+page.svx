# Item Components

Item components are data structures which can be applied to items in Minecraft to give them special attributes, such as
a name, lore, being able to be eaten, etc. Each item has specific item components by default - for example, all food
items will have the [`minecraft:consumable`](#consumable) component, which makes the item edible.

A command such as `/give` or `/item` can be used to create an item which has additional item components, or remove item
components from any item.

You can check out all the components and their structure on the Minecraft Wiki: https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_component_format#List_of_components
