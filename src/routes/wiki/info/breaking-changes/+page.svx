# List of breaking changes

This is list of all breaking changes to datapacks (excluding resource packs). Special thanks to Misode's Technical
Changelog for the source of many of these.

## 1.21.2

### [24w33a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w33a)

- Attribute IDs do not have the `generic.`, `player.` or `zombie.` prefixes anymore.
- Removed liquid carvers and changed biome format (the `carvers` field is now just a list of carvers)

### [24w34a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w34a)

- The `food` item component no longer automatically allows consumption of food, and now only holds the data relating to
  it (meaning `nutrition`, `saturation` and `can_always_eat` are the only fields left in the component)
- üõ†Ô∏è To fix this, just add the `consumable` component: `consumable={}`. You can customise this, read more in the
  snapshot article.

### [24w35a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w35a)

- `/loot` command now returns an error when trying to drop from block without loot table (like air)
- Special loot table `empty` has been removed.
- Sheep now always uses a single loot table `entities/sheep`, but wool drops are still defined in sub-tables in
  `entities/sheep/<color>`

### [24w36a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w36a)

- A lot of moved textures in resource packs (all armour, wolf armour, elytra, llama decor, horse armour and armour trim
  files, and textures were moved to various new positions - you can view these in the vanilla resource pack)

### [24w37a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w37a)

- The `fire_resistant` component has been renamed to `damage_resistant`, with a new field:
  - `types` - A `#` damage type tag, where items in entity form with this component, will be resistant to the damage
    types included in the tag. Also affects whether it will be damaged when worn and damaged with this damage type.
- The `killed_by_crossbow` advancement was renamed to `killed_by_arrow`.
  - And will trigger whenever an arrow kills an entity, not just when fired from a crossbow.

### [24w39a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w39a)

- The previous `Lock` field of containers has been renamed to `lock` and is now an item predicate. (The lock data
  component is now also an item predicate)
- `boat` and `chest_boat` entity types have been split into separate types, one per variant (Type=oak ->
  minecraft:oak_boat,...)
  - Meaning the `minecraft:boat` entity sub-predicate has been removed.

### [24w40a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w40a)

- You now cannot ride Leash Knots, Lighting Bolts and Fishing Bobbers anymore with `/ride` command.
- Renamed effect type `damage_item` to `change_item_damage`, now also supports negative amounts.

Good luck fixing your datapacks, and you can always ask for help in one of our help channels if you need üëç -# Last
