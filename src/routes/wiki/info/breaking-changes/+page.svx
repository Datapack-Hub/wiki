# List of breaking changes

This is list of all breaking changes to datapacks (excluding resource packs). Special thanks to Misode's Technical
Changelog for the source of many of these.

## 1.21.2
**Item Components**
- The [`food`](/wiki/commands/item-components#food) item component no longer automatically allows for consumption of food, and now only holds the data relating to it (meaning `nutrition`, `saturation` and `can_always_eat` are the only fields left in the component)
  - üõ†Ô∏è To fix this, just add the [`consumable`](/wiki/commands/item-components#consumable) component: `consumable={}`. You can customize this component even more, you can read about it [here](/wiki/commands/item-components#consumable).
- The [`lock`](/wiki/commands/item-components#lock) has been changed into an item predicate, with a format of `lock={ITEM_PREDICATE}`
  - üõ†Ô∏è The previous `lock="MyKey"` would now look like `lock={components:{"minecraft:custom_name":"'MyKey'"}}`
- The `fire_resistant` component has been renamed to [`damage_resistant`](/wiki/commands/item-components#damage_resistant), with a new field
  - `types` - A `#` damage type tag. Items in entity form or worn by players with this component will be resistant to the damage types included in the tag.

**Loot Tables**
- The `/loot` command now returns an error when trying to drop from block without loot table (like air)
- The special loot table `empty` has been removed.
- Sheep now always use a single loot table `entities/sheep`, but wool drops are still defined in sub-tables in  `entities/sheep/<color>`

**Other**
- Attribute IDs now don't have the `generic.`, `player.` or `zombie.` prefixes anymore (`generic.scale` -> `scale`).
- `boat` and `chest_boat` entity types have been split into separate types, one per variant (`Type=oak` ->
`minecraft:oak_boat`,...)
  - With that the `minecraft:boat` entity sub-predicate has been removed.
- The previous `Lock` field of containers has been renamed to `lock` and is now an item predicate.
- You now cannot ride Leash Knots, Lighting Bolts and Fishing Bobbers with `/ride` command.
- The `killed_by_crossbow` advancement was renamed to `killed_by_arrow`, and will now trigger whenever an arrow kills an entity, not just when fired from a crossbow.
- Renamed effect type `damage_item` to `change_item_damage`, which now also supports negative amounts.
- Removed liquid carvers and changed biome format (the `carvers` field is now just a list of carvers)

## 1.20.2
- Entity effects in NBT now use namespaced IDs instead of numbers.
- The structure for entity effects in NBT has been changed from `PascalCase` to `snake_case`.
  - For mob effect instances:
    - `Id` ‚Üí `id`
    - `Ambient` ‚Üí `ambient`
    - `Amplifier` ‚Üí `amplifier`
    - `Duration` ‚Üí `duration`
    - `ShowParticles` ‚Üí `show_particles`
    - `ShowIcon` ‚Üí `show_icon`
    - `HiddenEffect` ‚Üí `hidden_effect`
    - `FactorCalculationData` ‚Üí `factor_calculation_data`
  - For others:
    - `CustomPotionEffects` ‚Üí `custom_potion_effects` (potion, lingering_potion, splash_potion, tipped_arrow, arrow)
    - `Effects` ‚Üí `effects` (suspicious_stew, area_effect_cloud)
    - `EffectId` ‚Üí id` (suspicious_stew)
    - `EffectDuration` ‚Üí `duration` (suspicious_stew)
    - `EffectId` and `EffectDuration` ‚Üí stew_effects (mooshroom)
    - `ActiveEffects` ‚Üí `active_effects` (player, armor_stand, mobs)
    - `Primary` ‚Üí `primary_effect` (beacon)
    - `Secondary` ‚Üí `secondary_effect` (beacon)
