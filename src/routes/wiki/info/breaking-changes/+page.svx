# List of breaking changes

This is list of all breaking changes to datapacks (excluding resource packs). Special thanks to Misode's Technical
Changelog for the source of many of these.

## 1.21.2
- **Item Component changes**
  - The `food` item component no longer automatically allows for consumption of food, and now only holds the data relating to it (meaning `nutrition`, `saturation` and `can_always_eat` are the only fields left in the component)
    - üõ†Ô∏è To fix this, just add the `consumable` component: `consumable={}`. You can customize this component even more, you can read about it [here](/wiki/commands/item-components#consumable).
  - The [`lock`](/wiki/commands/item-components#lock) has been changed into an item predicate, with a format of `lock={ITEM_PREDICATE_HERE}`
    - üõ†Ô∏è The previous `lock="MyKey"` would now look like `lock={components:{"minecraft:custom_name":"'MyKey'"}}`
  - The `fire_resistant` component has been renamed to `damage_resistant`, with a new field
    - `types` - A `#` damage type tag. Items in entity form or worn by players with this component will be resistant to the damage types included in the tag.
- **Loot Table changes**
  - The `/loot` command now returns an error when trying to drop from block without loot table (like air)
  - The special loot table `empty` has been removed.
  - Sheep now always use a single loot table `entities/sheep`, but wool drops are still defined in sub-tables in  `entities/sheep/<color>`
- Attribute IDs now don't have the `generic.`, `player.` or `zombie.` prefixes anymore (`generic.scale` -> `scale`).
- Removed liquid carvers and changed biome format (the `carvers` field is now just a list of carvers)
- The `killed_by_crossbow` advancement was renamed to `killed_by_arrow`, and will now trigger whenever an arrow kills an entity, not just when fired from a crossbow.
- The previous `Lock` field of containers has been renamed to `lock` and is now an item predicate.
- `boat` and `chest_boat` entity types have been split into separate types, one per variant (`Type=oak` ->
  `minecraft:oak_boat`,...)
  - With that the `minecraft:boat` entity sub-predicate has been removed.
- You now cannot ride Leash Knots, Lighting Bolts and Fishing Bobbers with `/ride` command.
- Renamed effect type `damage_item` to `change_item_damage`, which now also supports negative amounts.

- **Some Resourcepack Changes** 
  - **Note:** This DOES NOT include all breaking resourcepack changes, just the most important ones.
  - A lot of moved textures in resource packs (all armour, wolf armour, elytra, llama decor, horse armour and armour trim files, and textures were moved to various new positions - you can view these in the vanilla resource pack)


## 1.20.2
